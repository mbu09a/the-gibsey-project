The process begins with an observation, any observation, like staring at a screen, or outside a window, or looking into a frame, or even just staring out of one's own eyes, watching something, anything really. It requires the eye, or the mind's eye if vision isn't possible at the time due to mental or medical conditions or aberrations, or requires one to see something outside of oneself or to mistake something as outside themselves. However, this first observation doesn't involve full awareness of the thing being observed but instead involves a feigned sense of awareness, or a lack of awareness, distractions, lapses, or a distancing of oneself, one could say a separation. Although it might not quite make sense for this unconscious process to be consciously induced, it is, in fact, quite possible, and if anything, we do it all the time. Ever lost your train of thought? Ever started day-dreaming at work while the coffee's still steaming? Ever fell into a place that wasn't quite sleeping or waking, but was something else, somewhere else, entirely? There are entire places, such as Gibsey World, dedicated to inducing such states of mind in their viewers. It's a theme park, after all, a manufacturer of observations and excessive projections.

But the unconscious element is just the first step.
