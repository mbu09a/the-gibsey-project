They don't remember their place, their specific place, within the progression of the unfolding narrative.

They're always forgetting.

They don't remember that time itself is an unfolding narrative. It tells of an author, The Author, The Author of a film that's being created by an author, a film that's forever being screened, at all times, that's always being made and remade, that's always being played, always screening through the ever-expanding terrains of this amusement park, inside and outside of Malt Gibsey World, though now nothing exists outside Gibsey World, a film that-much like their own work-is also called, The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey.

They don't remember that this film is a work of adaptation that's intended to reflect the reality of their world, a theme park.

It is a park of themes.

It's a reality show as film. It's a filmed reality, a captured reality, the film itself being somewhat of a remake of that Gibseyan classic The Truman Show since, like all narratives, it involves a set constructed around a character without their knowledge, one which they didn't know was being constructed around them, that they're unaware of, or which they can't remember, one which was outside of their control.
