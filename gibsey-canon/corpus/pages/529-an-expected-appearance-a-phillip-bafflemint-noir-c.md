Judy had come across fairly ominously back there. He won't be able to shake the strangeness of their interaction from his mind, yet somehow, he still doesn't want to believe it, and come to think of it, the info he's collected on Manny Valentinas has become increasingly sparse, let alone the info on London Fox. He doesn't even know what either of them looked like, or if either of them even exist or even disappeared, or even which one he was supposed to be pursuing any longer, for that matter. All he knows is that one of them wrote a lot to the point that it's cluttered up their living space, and that whomever they were, they were deeply mystical, had an interest in both religious and scientific fields-an oddity, for sure, but not unheard of, although maybe more common in ancient contexts rather than modern ones-and maybe most importantly, or seemingly most importantly, that they'd created a theme park.

Was it a real theme park?

Was this Author threatening to compete with Gibsey? Trying to bring it down?

Or were they an admirer of it?

Maybe even a part of it?
