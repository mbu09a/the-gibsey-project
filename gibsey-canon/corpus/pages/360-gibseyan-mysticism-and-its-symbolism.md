Before she underwent the procedure, the version of herself that she now considers to be the even more originally original version of herself, she had originally had a career as an academic. She was a Gibstorian, a writer, and a mystic, and this was (and still is) the same set of roles which her newly remade self has continued to pursue, becoming even more successful than the original Natalie had ever been before undergoing the procedure.

She'd expected this to be a good thing and technically, she supposed it was.

It was certainly promised as such, but like so many truths of the procedure, things had not gone as expected or promised, at least not internally. Externalities, as always, had presented themselves. The procedure was supposed to give her more time, to give her the opportunity to distance herself from the complexity and preconditioned obligations of her previous life, to open up whole new worlds for herself which she could live in separately, without worry or anxiety, like an endless vacation, at least it was marketed as such, and although it had created an artificial or extended version of these promises and these promises seemed to have come true from the outside, internally, all it had really opened up for her was a portal to an endless past, decay, a reformation and spiraling into death rather than an escape from one.

But the marketing had at least been partially accurate, she could admit, because she certainly did have plenty of time on her hands.

If anything, all she had was time.
