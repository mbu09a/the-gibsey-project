How can I not know how it is that I came here?

I wonder if I should have mentioned this to the doctor, me experiencing the horrifying depth and nuanced totality of my crushing depersonalization?

It's probably better that I didn't.

Who's to say that is or isn't my ailment?

How do I even know it's affecting me?

It's not.

It's not affecting me

Not at all.

I'm out on a walk.

I'm in the middle of a queue line, and I'm learning to be happy.

I turn the corner.

Wait, I'd forgotten, the spigot wasn't a midway point?

This was early on in the queue?

Good Gibsey, they're getting much worse, aren't they?

The images.

Much, much worse.
