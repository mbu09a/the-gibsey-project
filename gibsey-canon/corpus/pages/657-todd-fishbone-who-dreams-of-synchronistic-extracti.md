Todd flips through a couple pages to check.

Ah, yeah. He'll just skip it.

And so they follow where that horseman pointed for quite a ways and then they come to this crazy looking figure-

Wait, was this the automaton, maybe? Or well, ehhh, he guesses the horseman maybe could've been? It was at least this crazy technological tool but I don't know if it was? Oh, wait, no! This was more of a magical creature! Oh! That's right. Shit, and it's freaky-deaky looking too, damn.

It has these two great wings and four arms, two of them, it says are "like the arms of the son of Adam"-so he guesses that means like our arms? Human arms? The hell?-and the other two are made out of lion's paws with claws of iron-damn-and they're black and tall and extra freaky-deaky looking, "with hair like horses' tails and eyes like blazing coals, slit upright in his face. Moreover, he had in the middle of his forehead a third eye, as it were that of a lynx, from which flew sparks of fire."

Damn, that's gotta be some sorta demonic creature or Jinn or something like that, right?
