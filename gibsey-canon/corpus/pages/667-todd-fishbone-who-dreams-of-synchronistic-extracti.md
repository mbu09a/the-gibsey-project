And so the Shaykh makes it inside the city, he passes all these dead bodies-again, it's so similar to the palace they'd entered before? How had he forgotten? It was so strange?--and he-the Shaykh-he-he-

The portal?! The portal!?

The most recent episode of the podcast which Todd had just finished recording that very morning had been about portals, in particular portals and the Roman god Janus. He'd done research into Janus, finding out that Janus was the god of transitions and dualities, beginnings and endings. Often portrayed with two faces, one facing the past on the left, and the other facing the future on the right. Janus also held a key in his right hand, which symbolized the protection of doors, gates, thresholds, and other separations or openings between spatial boundaries. He was the keeper of the keys and the guardian of gateways.
