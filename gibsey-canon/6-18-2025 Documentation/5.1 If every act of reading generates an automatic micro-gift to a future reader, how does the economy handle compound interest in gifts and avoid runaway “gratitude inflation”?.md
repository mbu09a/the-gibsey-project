### Overview

In Gibsey’s gift‑economy each _page‑read_ mints a **micro‑gift (μ‑gift)** that is automatically escrowed for an as‑yet‑unknown future reader. If left unchecked, the chained “thank‑you → thank‑you‑for‑your‑thank‑you” feedback could explode—much like compounding interest in a bank account with no reserve requirements. Below is a blueprint for preventing **gratitude inflation** while preserving the enchantment of giving‑forward.

## 1 Accounting Primitive: the **Gift‑Gradient**

Every μ‑gift carries a **gradient value g ∈ (0, 1]**—think of it as the distance it can still travel through time.

- Minted at **g = 1.0** when Reader‑0 finishes a page.
    
- Each time the gift is _re‑gifted_ (i.e., Reader‑k consumes it and seeds a new one), multiply by a decay factor **λ < 1**.
    

gk+1=λ gkwith  λ=system‑wide “gratitude half‑life”g_{k+1}=λ \, g_k \quad\text{with}\; λ=\text{system‑wide “gratitude half‑life”}

### Practical Choice

`λ ≈ 0.707` (half‑life of √2 hops) means after 10 hand‑offs the gradient shrinks to < 6 %.

## 2 Compound Interest, but **Capped and Quantised**

1. **Finite Horizon** – A μ‑gift is only transmissible while _g ≥ g_min_.  
    _Below that, it auto‑burns into the communal reserve._
    
    > Prevents geometric runaway: the chain length is logarithmic in 1/g_min.
    
2. **Discreet Rounding** – Values are stored in a fixed‑point lattice (e.g., 1/256 ths).  
    _Very small fractions round to zero early_, containing dust explosions.
    
3. **Reserve Ratio (ρ)** – For every μ‑gift minted, **ρ × value** is siphoned into a _Gift Reserve Pool_.  
    _If circulation ever exceeds a target CPI_, the protocol raises ρ, slowing net issuance.

## 3 Dynamic **Gratitude Index (GI)**

Define a real‑time metric:

GI(t)=Total μ‑gift purchasing power in circulation7‑day moving sum of page reads\text{GI}(t) = \frac{\text{Total μ‑gift purchasing power in circulation}}{\text{7‑day moving sum of page reads}}

- **Target GI ≈ 1** → one “unit” of gratitude per new read.
    
- Smart contract adjusts **λ** (decay) and **ρ** (reserve) every epoch so GI gravitates toward 1, the way a central bank targets price inflation.

## 4 Demurrage for the _Hoarder’s Dilemma_

To stop users from stockpiling high‑gradient gifts:

- **Clock‑Tick Demurrage** – Each gift loses Δd % of its gradient per 24 h unspent, on top of decay λ.
    
- **Narrative Justification** – In‑world, gratitude “fades” if not passed on; Princhetta calls it _the soft forgetting_.

## 5 Rewarding Early & Deep Participation (Positive Side‑Effects)

|Behaviour|Economic Signal|Gift Mechanic|
|---|---|---|
|**Early reading of fresh pages**|Scarcer gifts|Minting bonus: initial gradient starts at 1 + β|
|**Re‑gifting quickly**|Faster circulation|Demurrage avoided; potential tipping tokens|
|**Curating timeless pages**|Social capital|Curators earn _grandparent dividends_ (fraction of downstream decay burn)|

---

## 6 Edge‑Case Safeguards

1. **Temporal Forks (Retrocausal Branching)**  
    If the page a gift points to is overwritten, the μ‑gift’s gradient _splits_ across descendant branches by readership weight—total value conserved.
    
2. **Sybil Resistance**  
    Reader identity proven via zero‑knowledge proofs tied to device entropy; prevents bot farms from mint‑farming.
    
3. **Catastrophic Deflation**  
    Should GI < 0.6 for N epochs, λ is temporarily raised toward 1 (slower decay) and ρ is lowered—protocol auto‑stimulates gifting.

## 7 Worked Example

|Hop|Reader|Gift Gradient|Reserve Contribution (ρ = 0.15)|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|Alice|1.00|0.15 burned to reserve|
|1|Bob|0.70|0.105|
|2|Carol|0.49|0.0735|
|3|— (g < g_min = 0.50)|**auto‑burn**|—|

_Chain halts after Bob; Carol’s read still minted a new μ‑gift, but hers expired the moment it fell below `g_min`._

## 8 Interface Cues

- **Gradient Bar** – A tiny aura encircles the page‑number icon; its brightness reflects g.
    
- **Reserve Pulse** – When GI tilts high, the aura subtly dims platform‑wide, telegraphing “gratitude is plentiful—no need to overspend.”
    
- **Demurrage Whisper** – Idle gifts emit a fading chime; Princhetta nudges: _“Pass it on before memory fades.”_
    

---

## 9 Narrative & Ethical Resonance

- **Economy Mirrors Ecology** – Gratitude obeys entropy: usable energy (gifts) degrades unless renewed by fresh attention (new reads).
    
- **Prevents Zero‑Sum Hoarding** – Users who _sit_ on gratitude watch it evaporate; community flow is always cheaper than selfish accumulation.
    
- **Cultivates Mindful Curation** – Because high‑gradient gifts are scarce, bestowing one on a page is both a material tip **and** a narrative blessing, deepening engagement without driving runaway inflation.

### TL;DR

By attaching a **decaying gradient**, siphoning a **reserve ratio**, and steering the system with a **Gratitude Index**, Gibsey turns endless chains of “thank‑yous” into a **thermodynamically stable** flow of micro‑gifts. Readers still enjoy the magic of paying generosity forward, yet the protocol’s in‑built half‑life, reserve pool, and demurrage ensure the total “gratitude money supply” never outruns the actual act of reading that gives it value.
