Below is a reference design for a benchmarking “instrumentation stack” to prove that a specific user flow—**Read → Ask → Receive → Save**—completes in under **2 seconds** at the 95th percentile (P95). It includes how to collect performance metrics, how to generate synthetic load, and how to visualize the results in a Grafana dashboard.

## 1. Overview of the “2-Second Dream” Flow

1. **Read**: The system reads or retrieves necessary input data (e.g., from a cache or database).
2. **Ask**: The system makes a query or request (e.g., to an internal service, an external microservice, or an LLM).
3. **Receive**: The system receives the response from that external ask.
4. **Save**: The system writes the final result or response to persistence (e.g., a database or object storage).

**Goal**: This entire pipeline, from initial request to final save, must complete in **< 2 seconds** at P95 latency.

## 2. Instrumentation Stack

Below are the recommended components to instrument and measure each step of the pipeline:

### 2.1 Distributed Tracing (OpenTelemetry or Jaeger)

* **OpenTelemetry Instrumentation**:

  * Add tracing hooks in each microservice (or each function call if monolith) at these critical events:

    1. Start of `Read` operation.
    2. Outbound call to `Ask`.
    3. Inbound reception (`Receive`).
    4. Final `Save` write operation.
  * Each step logs timing info to a *trace span* with a name like `read_span`, `ask_span`, `receive_span`, `save_span`.

* **Trace Correlation**:

  * Pass a trace ID through the entire request cycle so the final aggregator (Jaeger or an OpenTelemetry collector) can piece together end-to-end latency.

### 2.2 Metrics Collection (Prometheus)

* **Counters**:

  * `requests_total` counting how many “Read → Ask → Receive → Save” cycles have started.
  * `errors_total` tracking how many errors/failures.
  * `request_duration_seconds` histogram or summary that measures total round-trip time.

* **Histograms** for the entire pipeline as well as for each individual step. For example:

  * `pipeline_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"}`: how many requests completed in ≤0.5s, etc.
  * `pipeline_duration_seconds_bucket{le="2"}`: how many requests completed in ≤2.0s.

* **Labels**:

  * `endpoint="read_ask_receive_save"` or break them out as `step=read`, `step=ask`, etc.
  * `status="success"`, `status="error"`, etc.

### 2.3 Logging

* **Structured Logs** (e.g. using JSON logs) that record:

  * `trace_id`, `span_id`
  * `timestamp_start` and `timestamp_end` for each step
  * Any relevant request metadata (user ID, request size, etc.)

* **Log Aggregation**:

  * Tools like Loki, Elasticsearch, or a standard aggregator so you can quickly investigate spikes in latency or errors.

## 3. Synthetic Load Generation Scripts

We need to drive a realistic or worst-case load to measure P95. A typical approach:

### 3.1 Script Tools

1. **k6** (Go-based, easy to script scenario flows)
2. **Locust** (Python-based, flexible user flow definitions)
3. **JMeter** or **Gatling** (Java/Scala-based, proven load tools)

### 3.2 Example k6 Script

Below is a simplified example in k6 that simulates the Read→Ask→Receive→Save cycle by calling one endpoint (or multiple endpoints if you break out each step).

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep, check } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '1m', target: 10 },   // ramp to 10 VUs
    { duration: '3m', target: 50 },   // ramp to 50 VUs
    { duration: '2m', target: 50 },   // sustain 50 VUs
    { duration: '1m', target: 0 }     // ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    'http_req_duration{scenario:read_ask_receive_save}': ['p(95)<2000'], // P95 < 2000 ms
  },
};

export default function () {
  // 1) Initiate 'Read' step (e.g. GET from some resource)
  let readRes = http.get('https://my-service.local/read');
  check(readRes, { 'read OK': (r) => r.status === 200 });

  // 2) 'Ask' step (e.g. POST to external service)
  let askBody = JSON.stringify({ data: readRes.json() });
  let askRes = http.post('https://my-service.local/ask', askBody);
  check(askRes, { 'ask OK': (r) => r.status === 200 });

  // 3) 'Receive' is part of the askRes time, but we log it separately in code or
  // using distributed tracing within the backend.

  // 4) 'Save' step
  let saveBody = JSON.stringify({ result: askRes.json() });
  let saveRes = http.post('https://my-service.local/save', saveBody);
  check(saveRes, { 'save OK': (r) => r.status === 200 });

  // Sleep a tiny bit to simulate user pacing
  sleep(1);
}
```

**Note**:

* The default `http_req_duration` metric in k6 measures each HTTP request. For end-to-end pipeline time, you might prefer a custom metric, or measure how long the entire function takes.
* You could also call one single endpoint that orchestrates *Read→Ask→Receive→Save* internally, then measure that single request’s duration.

### 3.3 Locust Example

A Pythonic approach in Locust would define a single user task that calls multiple endpoints in sequence or a single “orchestrator” endpoint. Then measure the total time or rely on distributed tracing in the backend to see the step-by-step breakdown.

## 4. Grafana Dashboard Specification

Below is a recommended set of panels in Grafana (assuming data is in Prometheus or an OTEL-compatible data source):

1. **Overall P95 Latency**

   * **Panel Type**: Single stat or time-series
   * **Query**: A percentile query on the total pipeline histogram, e.g.,

     ```
     histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (le) (rate(pipeline_duration_seconds_bucket[1m])))
     ```
   * **Threshold**: Visual marker at 2s

2. **Latency Distribution (Histogram)**

   * **Panel Type**: Bar graph or heatmap of `pipeline_duration_seconds_bucket`.
   * Helps see how many requests cluster around certain latencies.

3. **Step-by-Step Timings**

   * **Panel Type**: Multi-series time-chart of average or 95th percentile for `read_span`, `ask_span`, `receive_span`, `save_span`.
   * Query each span’s duration from your tracing data (exposed as metrics) or from microservices instrumented with Prometheus counters/histograms.

4. **Request Rate / Throughput**

   * **Panel Type**: Time-series
   * **Query**: `rate(requests_total[1m])` to see how many pipeline requests are processed per second.

5. **Error Rate**

   * **Panel Type**: Single stat or time-series
   * **Query**: `rate(errors_total[1m]) / rate(requests_total[1m]) * 100` as a percentage.

6. **Resource Utilization**

   * **Panel Type**: Time-series for CPU, memory, possibly network or disk usage.
   * **Prometheus Node Exporter** or container-level metrics to show if we’re saturating any resources.

7. **SLO / Apdex Panel** (Optional)

   * Summarizes how many requests complete under 2s vs. how many exceed that threshold.

**Dashboard Layout Example**:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| [Panel 1: Overall P95 Latency]    [Panel 2: SLO % ] |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| [Panel 3: Latency Distribution ]                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| [Panel 4: Step Timings by Span ]                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| [Panel 5: Request Rate]       [Panel 6: Error Rate]|
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| [Panel 7: CPU/Memory Usage per Service]            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

## 5. End-to-End Verification Flow

1. **Deploy**: Ensure each service is instrumented with OpenTelemetry or direct Prometheus metrics.
2. **Start Synthetic Load**: Run `k6` or `Locust` with a script that replicates the **Read → Ask → Receive → Save** flow.
3. **Observe Metrics**:

   * In Grafana, watch the **Overall P95 Latency** panel. Ensure it’s consistently < 2s.
   * Check the **Step-by-Step Timings** panel to see if any single step (Read, Ask, Receive, Save) is spiking.
4. **Check Logs & Traces**:

   * If P95 spikes above 2s, correlate trace logs in Jaeger or your aggregator to see the culprit.
5. **Report & Tuning**:

   * If needed, optimize caching, concurrency, or infrastructure to keep P95 ≤ 2s.
6. **Repeat**:

   * Bump load, retest, confirm it stays within SLO under expected concurrency.

---

## 6. Summary

By combining:

* **Distributed Tracing** (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger)
* **Metrics Collection** (Prometheus with histograms)
* **Synthetic Load** (k6/Locust scripts that replicate the pipeline flow)
* **A Grafana Dashboard** presenting P95 latency, throughput, error rate, and resource usage

…you can definitively prove that the “Read → Ask → Receive → Save” cycle completes in **< 2 seconds** at P95 under representative loads, thus achieving the **2-Second Dream Benchmark**.
