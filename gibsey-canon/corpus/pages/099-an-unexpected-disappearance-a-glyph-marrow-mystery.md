Glyph's arms hang at his side, head forward, always facing forward, like a straight line, waiting in line, waiting in line, waiting-

And the words, they almost saved him.

For once they'd somehow coalesced and combined.

Glyph had almost found his own agency, escaped down the curve, back to the station platform, the queue line, the air filling his nostrils, then again, maybe he has achieved his own agency, because he can still picture a train coming into the station, another form of unfamiliarity, even his grasp was empty, complete with faux-wood paneling, just moments away, just moments away, just moments of near-endless duration, the echoes of dripping water and pickaxes, liquid fumigation.

Words are devices, dark, devilish devices, that can be used to harness all kinds of potential power, and words are somehow combined as he sees a train coming into the station, grasping echoes moments away from the curve, escaping the queue line, to remember, and they led him here to this cart, to the bottom of the hill waiting for the climb, waiting in line.

Can't it just stop?

Can't it all just fucking stop?!
