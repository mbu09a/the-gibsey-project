Like I said, I respect his commitment.

Hell, I even admire it.

I'm a lover of the movies myself, but gibeydamnit, I'm also the CEO of this gibseydamn thing, and did I mention the fucking budget?

My fucking Gibsey!

And the crew's getting really worried by this point.

They've all put up with a lot by now, to say the least, and I'm gonna have to find some leverage somewhere.

It's started to get very, very serious, Ariel.

During dailies, Scrillio hasn't been keeping the shots straight and together in his mind like he used to, even with his script supervisor being as clear as possible with him, going over the notes in detail, like I am with you, explaining to him with as much precision as possible which sequence or shot he's being shown at any given time, even with everyone in the room anticipating his reaction, he seems to be hallucinating images entirely, rather than the one's he's being shown. What I mean is that, when he describes the dailies back to members of his crew, entire sequences within his perception seem to have replaced the original sequences. It's as if he isn't even seeing what's actually there, like he's somehow watching another film other than the one that he himself shot, like it was also being shot simultaneously.

And how do you create that kind of film and watch that fucking movie?

That's what I want to fucking know.
