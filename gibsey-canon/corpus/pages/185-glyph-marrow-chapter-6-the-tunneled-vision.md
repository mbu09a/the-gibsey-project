"It's a sea of death.

"A tempestuous storm.

"A fictional construct.

"It may even be more powerful than language itself.

"You can hear it talking to itself, with itself. You can watch it having a dialogue with itself, at any given time.

"And it's doing this all the time

"And we are its language.

"We are the language that it speaks.

"It is now what animates us.

"We think we can escape it, that we aren't moved by it. That by ignoring it, it will go away, that only the fools are the ones participating in it, but we all participate in it. We all do. It touches and transforms everything it touches, and soon it will touch all things.

"We can try to run from it, can try to retreat like Jonah to Tarshish, but it will find us. It found me, and I've been transformed. It may seem like a positive transformation, and maybe outwardly, to you, it will be, but you do not know my inner world. It's terrifying, Arieol. It speaks inside me, and through me. It has shoved its hands up through my insides and it's manipulating my mouth. It has made me into its lonesome puppet. It has entered into me through my words, and now, even as I speak, I don't know if it's me who's speaking or if it's-it's-it's horrifying."
