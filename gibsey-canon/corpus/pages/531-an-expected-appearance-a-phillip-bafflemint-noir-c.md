He had to have been making errors himself, slips, errors of both a conscious and unconscious variety, simply because he felt like some bigger picture was being withheld from him, and the only person whom he could think of, so far at least, that would be withholding such data, would be Judy.

But maybe that wasn't such a big deal?

Everyone could forgive unconscious errors because they were accidental. They weren't purposeful. They were circumstantial and therefore didn't force one to take blame for them. But mistakes, on the other hand, functioned in an opposite way.

They necessitated blame.

Surely his world would be improved if mistakes were corrected more harshly and slips were given more grace, or at the very least, more understanding.

Or maybe there isn't as much of a difference between the two?

Maybe it should be gracious understanding all the way down?

After all, how can you be blamed for something you're not even able to be fully conscious of while it's happening? And even if the problem of a mistake would be that one should've known better, who was to say anyone could have ever truly known better? Was it just the difference between naivety and chosen ignorance?
