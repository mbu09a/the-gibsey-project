Arieol pauses his chatterering for a moment to observe the specimen seated alongside them, a decision which doesn't seem to calm Glyph down in the slightest.

The cart diagonally arches towards the sky.

"You know what? Give me a second here, Glyph, to pause time just one more time now that we're starting The First Ascent. I've got some things I wanted to expand upon."

Time, again, seems to halt, as does the minecart, under what appears to be the wooden structure of some sort of oil derrick that rises above the entrance to The First Ascent. Arieol turns to face Glyph, still cradling their unlit cigar. This time, looking and sounding a bit heavier as they continue, as if a certain amount of importance, rather than simple play, has wiggled its way into their communicative measures.

"What were we talking about again? Oh, yes! Dialogue! We were discussing dialogue, or I was monologuing about dialogue, though surely even your suggested presence alone, highly participated in or not, does have an effect on what I choose to communicate about, maybe even directly. And isn't it strange, Glyph, how audiences so often clamor for what they've grown so accustomed to rather than for what the thing is actually called: a novel."

Glyph grits his teeth, growing hot, agitated.
