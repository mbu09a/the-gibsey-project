Their reason tonight was that in 3 days, they had a social event they'd be going to, with people of years and brains and illuminated experiences, and goddamn it if they could just finish An Unexpected Disappearance and have something substantial to show them, which 7 days ago-they'd noticed when criss-crossing the multi-layered, clattering system of "to-be-written" plans-was to be made up of 10 chapters, and they'd coincidentally noticed this 10 days before they were to leave to visit these friends of theirs, so they didn't really have a choice, did they? Even if the novel within the novel was some sort of outgrowth or parasite which had metastasized from the host of the original book, or game, or movie, or pain in the fucking ass-whatever it is or was to become--at least it was something.

So it would be a late night, most likely.

The bags of their eyes would be circled purple and droop like the jowls of a bloodhound, their actual eyes would get all red, blotched, aching with exhaustion, and they'd just have to pow'r on through.

Huh? Makes them think of that monster they'd written about earlier?

Maybe it was them?

2 days still left to go after today.

You stupid ass mother fucker.

You're so near the end!
