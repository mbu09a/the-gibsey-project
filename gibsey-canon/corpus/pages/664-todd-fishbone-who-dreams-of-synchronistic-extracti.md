He'd made it clear when discussing this experience on the podcast and writing about it on the blog that it hadn't been while he was using the restroom.

It wasn't anything like that.

No, he'd already finished his business by that point.

It happened afterwards.

And it was the strangest thing.

It wasn't outside him.

He wasn't sucked up into a UFO.

A laser beam hadn't beamed down to pull him up and out the landscape.

It had been invaded him from within.

He was alien.

This is what he'd realized.

We are all aliens.

We are the aliens of ourselves.

And he'd stared out at his hands and had felt completely and totally, well, alien, like he'd been alive for a thousand years, and had visited this place, over and over again.

It was like a demon possession.

Like a jinn.

And now this?

This had all happened?

And all of it had connected.

The chatbot's passage and the 1001 Nights, and The City of Brass, all of it.
