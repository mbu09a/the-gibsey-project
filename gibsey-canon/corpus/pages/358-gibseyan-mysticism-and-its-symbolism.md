This was because she knew, deep down, that a representation of herself was out there, living out a public life, her own public life. And she knows this, that they've slowly replaced her, have been slowly replacing her, piece by piece, and this happens, has happened, while her real self, her private self, who she is, who she has now become eternally shackled to, sits in bed, day after day, with nothing left to do but to wait to be forgotten.

But she's already been forgotten.

Because she's already been replaced.

She will spend the rest of her time, now that she has so much of it, pouring over her past, and all these endless myths of hers, all these endless versions of her past self, and this will be the last time they'll now get the chance to tumble through her before they themselves are also fated to fade out, to forget, as well as so many of the others who are now also fated towards death, just like her, so many of the others who had undergone the same procedure and it's promises who were now to be beseeched by the early deaths brought about by the procedure-endless, unpredictable and unintended mental deaths which would now occur and recur until everything was entirely forgotten.

The process of forgetting had already begun.

And like the procedure, once undertaken, there was no going back.
