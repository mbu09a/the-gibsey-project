All empty.

All devoid of life.

They find all this loot left behind.

Weapons and gems and perfumes.

Treasures galore.

There's so much of it.

And then they come into this passage-

They come into this place, this new place-

They see these birds made out of rubies and pearls-wait, yes, he remembers, this is the section with the automaton-and they come to a damsel.

He reads the passage-this section-over and over again, unable to believe his eyes.

"She wore a tight-fitting body-robe of fine pearls, with a crown of red gold on her head, filleted with gems, and on her forehead were two great jewels, whose light was as the light of the sun. On her breast she wore a jewelled amulet, filled with musk and ambergris and worth the empire of the Caesars; and around her neck hung a collar of rubies and great pearls, hollowed and filled with odoriferous musk. And it seemed as if she gazed on them to the right and to the left."

To the right and to the left?

And then the Scherazade frame narrative interrupts.

Ah, damn it! He was going to skip that!

He does.
