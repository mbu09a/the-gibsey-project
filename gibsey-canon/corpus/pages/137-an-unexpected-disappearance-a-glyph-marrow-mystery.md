Is The Author of An Unexpected Disappearance a Subversionist, a Post-Subversionist, or just a plain old ADD agent posing as an author? That's your question? Are you serious? (Laughs)

Well, you've clearly attended some of my other courses, haven't you?

How do I even begin to answer that? (Laughs)

I don't know all of your backgrounds, so that question forces me to do the impossible and distill the Gibstory of Gibseyan Mysticism, or at least of The Corpus, one of its most sacred texts, in an insanely short amount of time, but I appreciate the challenge, and I'll try. I don't think I can answer that without at least a little context, and I'm going to go over time, so if any of you need to leave early, you're welcome to it.

This is a class about Gibseyan Mysticism, and as you all probably well know, the more mystical and esoterically focused adherents of Gibseyanity, study the symbolism and meaning found within the mystically sacred text known as The Corpus. This text is a set of 16 symbolic images (a number that slowly both increases and decreases with time as symbols are added and removed from The Corpus's text). The Corpus's symbols contain a set of literary correspondences, each also representing a ride within the theme park that is our world.
