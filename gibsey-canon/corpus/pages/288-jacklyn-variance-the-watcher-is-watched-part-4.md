After this observation is made-if "made" is even the correct term-a second observation is then necessary of the same material, and conscious awareness of this material is then implemented. The two observations are then combined into something other than their constituent parts, helping the observer, or analyst, to see things within their perceptions that would otherwise be unobtainable to their senses.

Something Jacklyn knows that very few of her ilk seem to be aware of, or at least most don't seem consciously aware of just yet, is that data analysis, retrieval, and observation is not factual, or at least certainly isn't entirely factual, because the "factual" material of one's observations are only what is taken in during the 2nd part of this process. Subjectivity may be discouraged, and even greatly frowned upon within A.D.D. discourse, but as Jacklyn has begun to reflect, and more and more everyday, this discouragement may not be to thwart or undo this said subjectivity, as is often thought; it may instead be to protect it. It's A.D.D. policy that the more unconscious one's 1st observation, and the more aware the 2nd observation, the better.
