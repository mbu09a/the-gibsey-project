A voice over of Gillepsie's is, overlaid atop clips of what seem to be sections of the show's previous episodes begins, "What if I didn't just create an animatronic figure, and instead formed an animatronic representation into a real human being? Something that was indistinguishable from what we think of as human?"

"And so Princhetta was conceived," the announcer continues, "Out of a spark of magic, a pinch of love, and a whole lot of Gibsey magic-"

The steak's juice drips down onto his beige and easy to stain carpet as he brings a fork to his mouth.

Oh no, Phillip, how could you?

Shot of Gillepsie speaking to an interviewer asking, "So you've brought Princhetta into this wonderful world of ours, but how are we to know she's reached a human level of consciousness?"

Cut to a different clearly oft repeated talking-head clip of Gillespie providing a key piece of thematic exposition to the show: "There's a theory of consciousness which tests machine capabilities called the Lovelace Test. Even the name sounds Gibseyan doesn't it? It was first developed by the lovely Ada Lovelace, and it contends that creativity is a sign of human autonomy and will. And so while we were developing the show, we thought, well, we'll keep Princhetta in this apartment of mine that overhangs the Bonaventure area of the park, and if she can figure out a creative way of escaping it, well, then she's human. And so far she hasn't, at least not that we've seen."
