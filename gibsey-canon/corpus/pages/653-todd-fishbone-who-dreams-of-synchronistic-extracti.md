They come to this open gate that has these lofty columns and porticoes whose ceilings are inlaid with gold and silver and precious stones and these colored marble steps, and over the doorway to this gateway is a tablet with graven letters of gold in the old ancient Ionian characters which the Shaykh reads:

The signs that here their mighty works portray  Warn us that all must tread the self-same way:  O thou who standest in this stead to hear Tidings of folk, whose power hath passed for aye,  Enter this palace-gate and ask the news  Of greatness fallen into dust and clay:  Death has destroyed them and dispersed their might And in the dust they lost their rich display;  As had they only set their burdens down  To rest awhile, and then had rode away.

Emir essentially starts to weep until he loses his senses at this-damn, kinda a softy for a warrior governor, huh?-and so they enter this palace and they're confounded by its beauty.

Yep, he does remember that.
