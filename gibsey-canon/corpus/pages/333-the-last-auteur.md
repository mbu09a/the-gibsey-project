And like all narratives, I have to let Scrillio reach his peak, his climax. You see, I want him to reach a breaking point, one that he can't recover from, because at that point, that's when I can rein it all back in. Once he crosses that threshold, there's no returning, there's no: "But Oren, this is all for the art!" There's no: "Please, oh, please let me stay swaddled in my fucking man-child cacoon, please, oh please, oh please!"

Nuh-uh.

Nope.

None of that shit.

Once he crosses a certain number of lines, I'm the one who gains complete and total control.

And so I have to wait.

I can't lower the budget on 'the last auteur' just because he smells bad and his hair is disheveled!

I need cause, and it needs to be public, obvious, and inarguable.

I need to construct a narrative.

So I wait.

I keep watching him.

I wait, and I watch.

I watch him make his own bed.
