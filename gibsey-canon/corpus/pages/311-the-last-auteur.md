Don't write this one down-this-what I'm saying right now. What I'm telling you, or actually, you know what? Do note it, but don't note it for the script. Just make a note of it for me, ok? I may have to stop you to give you some context during this process. But when I give you that context--what I'm telling you right now-know it's not for the script and so don't put it in, OK? Do you understand?

Ok, good.

Myth, in general, Arieol, it's what makes all the stars shine and keeps them shining, every single one of them, across the screen of the sky that we call the cosmos. And it's always been that way. It's all about as ancient as supply and demand, or the invisible hand, and it's just about as mythic. It's our own way of keeping our composure, of making order out of chaos, of limiting the infinite, of staying sane within an insane reality, but it isn't real, and it never was.

And we all have to do it in our own way, don't we Arieol?

And some of us with more power and know-how than others, of course.
