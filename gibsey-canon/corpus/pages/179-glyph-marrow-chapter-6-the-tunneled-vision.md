"But you'd disappeared?"

"And so I've returned. Such as it often is. Back and forth, up and down, twists and turns. We're on a roller coaster, dummy! What did you think was gonna happen? You down for me to stop time for a bit again so we can continue to gab, or do you wanna just keep speeding this shit on up? Everybody's always so obsessed with getting to the end all the time! My Gibsey! Thanatos drive, much!"

"We can gab. We can gab. I'm OK with it."

Glyph has calmed. Crazy what staying atop a lift hill for a near eternity and being visited and maybe even flat-out possessed by an Eldritch Beast-like corporate entity can do to the skipping mind.

"Ah, well, do tell. What helped you embrace the fall?"

"The fall?" Glyph may be a bit more talkative, sure, but he's just as confused as ever, and will probably continue to be.

"Well, we're on the-what are we on? The seventh station of this contraption? The fifteenth? Hell if I know. The Second Ascent is what it looks like to me, right? I mean, I'm not as big a fan of it as you are, but I still know a thing or two. So, you've fallen into yourself, away from yourself, and you've gotten to sit back and ride some of the ride for once. Gotten to actually live a little. I'm happy for ya, Glyph buddy."
