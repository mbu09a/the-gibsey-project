Emir marvels at her exceeding beauty: "Confounded at the blackness of her hair and the redness of her cheeks, which made the beholder deem her alive and not dead, and said to her, 'Peace be with thee, O damsel!'"

But Talib interrupts, showing him that she isn't alive, she's dead, explaining that she will not be able to answer his greeting, saying "Indeed, she is but a corpse embalmed with exceeding art; her eyes were taken out after her death and quicksilver set under them, after which they were restored to their sockets. Wherefore they glisten and when the air moveth the lashes, she seemeth to wink and it appeareth to the beholder as though she looked at him, for all she is dead."

Emir is shocked and deeply moved by this-of course he fucking is-and they find more tablets which they read, tablets that warn them yet again about death, reaching this one phrase which does stick with Todd: "As thou seest us, and left what we had builded and all we had hoarded. This, then, is our story, and after the substance naught abideth but the trace."

Naught abideth but the trace.

He holds this phrase inside him, turning it within himself.

How very, very strange this place is-this book is.
