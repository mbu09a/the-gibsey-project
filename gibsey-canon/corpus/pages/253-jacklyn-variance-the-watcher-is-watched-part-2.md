One can never forget the ever present falling of the snow during such a scene.

The snow itself is brought to the foreground and arguably becomes the central image of the scene.

Nothing spreads more than snow.

Nothing collects itself to itself more, not even Gibsey World.

Nothing is more collective.

It is the plummeting and accumulation of purity itself, which the spring has come to desecrate.

Spring, in such a context, is the coming death, the ever present death, here to obliterate the winter just as Bambino's mother is soon to be obliterated.

The voices ring out.

The ringing out of gun fire, the eternal slap of the shot.

We shoot films like we shoot deer.

To film is to hunt.

And it is not the camera which has agency, or the hunter's rifle which snaps winter into sudden wakefulness, which leaves Bambino to forever wander, this time, a wandering much different than the initial wandering caused by the wonder of spring.

There may not be any agency to be found in such an image.
