So committed to your work and your ever-present need to escape from a reality that never needed escaping from to begin with, the "bomb rule", longing so deeply to exist somewhere other than the landscape you reside in, that you may as well have already died, but somehow, you live.

Wishing it was you instead of Preston.

Cliche as a Gibsey film.

The trailer of coming attractions.

But this time, it's feel-good entertainment.

A popcorn flick.

The return of a classic.

A remake.

Infinitely screening in the preserved-by-the-fact-that-they're-now-landmarks landmark theaters

The music swells.

A theme, already heard previously in the film, repeats.

A refrain.

The images, when they come on screen, fill you with so much; the screen evokes so much.

Nothing like placing your heart on your sleeve as you sit there in awe before the images.

And you watch yourself, finding yourself again in the theater.

I've seen you do it so many times.

I've seen the tears peeking out of your eyes.

And I've seen you rub at them, pretending that they were an itch.

But I know.

I saw you.

You're so beautiful, Variance.

And you don't even see that you are, so hardly are you given the chance to see yourself because you're always looking.

And it's this lack of awareness itself that animates you.
