They don't remember the voices ringing out.

The voices.

The voices ringing out.

They're always ringing out.

Remember?

Aren't they?

"Once more, one more time, again!"

"Remember?"

It's in the air.

Can you feel it?

Movement from place to place, cycles, lists of options, choices, transportation systems, beginnings and endings, restarts, restorations, false starts, repetitions, voices, visions, expositions, adaptations, all that data to be collected and recollected, recorded, blurred, blurring, and being blurred again.

All the screens shine across all the various landscapes.

Announcements are made.

"Keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times."

Charts, maps, guides.

The Magical Dominion.
