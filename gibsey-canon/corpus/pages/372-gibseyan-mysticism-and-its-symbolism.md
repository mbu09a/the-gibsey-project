Even with these recitations, and the important reminders that come with them, her despondency is fated to return to its ever-burgeoning advance because her awareness, her hallowed out inwardness, is one which she knows she'll never truly escape, and it is the repeated awareness that her current self, the newly made spectral-self of herself has now exited the doubling procedure to wander this disaster of a hotel-resort apartment augmented by the artifacts of her ever-deepening depressions. It is fated to plummet within her forever, as if tied to a heavy stone and thrust into the sea. It is her tumor, her cancer, her disease which will have no cure or antidote. She would never be able to return to the vibrant, helpful, enthusiastic version of herself that once was.

Once an extension of oneself is created, there is no going back.

And it isn't an exaggeration that her apartment is an unremitting disaster, either, so much so that she's given up on fixing any of it entirely, and as a result, she now refuses to take any visitors, refuses to maintain any sort of relationship with others whatsoever, with anyone, at least other than her friendship with her cloned, representative self.
