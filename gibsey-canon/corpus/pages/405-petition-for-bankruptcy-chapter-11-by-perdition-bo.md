Plan For Reorganization

Strategic Overview

As Perdition Books embarks on this vital phase of restructuring-or resurrecting or rebirthing or remaking-under Chapter 11, we propose a comprehensive plan for reorganization. This plan is designed to address the unique challenges we have faced, reinvigorate our operational model, and ensure a sustainable and ethical path forward in the publishing industry, at least as best we can under the utterly absurd Gibstrocial conditions which we find ourselves within.

Restructuring Financial Obligations

-Debt Renegotiation: We will negotiate with creditors to restructure our debt, seeking more favorable terms and extended repayment periods even though the concept of debt itself is an absurdity in the same way that copyright law is. As the Gibseyan proverb states, "If you owe the bank a thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a million dollars, you own the bank." Anyone with only a few brain cells left could see how ridiculous of a creed this would be to uphold within a theme park civilization.

-Asset Evaluation: Non-essential assets will be evaluated for potential sale to increase liquidity. Including Cop-E-Right, Mister-E-Man, Prit-E-Boi, Slop-E-Seconds, Prickle-E-Pear, and Stick-E-Situation, the AI chatbots which the subsidiary developed and which themselves may soon threaten to take their content creation elsewhere if steps aren't taken.

-Cost Management: Rigorous cost-cutting measures will be implemented, focusing on operational efficiency and reduction of overhead expenses. Rather than developing AIs to replace the cost of human beings, one cost management scheme already being used by many, if not most, or even all of AI associated companies, developers, and publishers, is to use human beings to replace the costs of AI. What else is AI for but to achieve that purpose? Just like human creativity, its content isn't created in a vacuum. It and we are all outside.
