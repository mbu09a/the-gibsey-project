All that repression, that's likely where it'd all come from.

Stephen had died from a blood clot, The Author remembers. They'd gone to get lunch with Stephen's Dad months after it had happened to collect that specific piece of data. Couldn't believe it, even still. Didn't want to. Blood clots? It made no damn sense.

But it didn't matter what they believed.

They can already tell they'll probably be pulling one of their weekly all-nighters, not that they have to stay up all night for any particular reason most weeks, they just usually try to find a reason to.
