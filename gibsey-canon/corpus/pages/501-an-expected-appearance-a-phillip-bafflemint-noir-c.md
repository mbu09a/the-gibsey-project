**An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir** **Chapter 4- The Slip and The Mistake**

This newly parasitic outgrowth-or return to Phillip Bafflemint's original story-begins with one of those classically cliche scenes commonly found within the opening sections of novels written by amateurish writers busy hitting tennis balls against the garage door-sigh-the cliche of a character waking up to greet the day of some newly acquired situation.

However, with this being the space where Phillip Bafflemint's soon to be developed inciting incident is to occur-a redundant and cliched term itself since, what can an incident do but incite?-the cliche in this case may not just be homogeneously repetitive, and may even also be true.

Not only this, but upon waking up on the damp carpet, Phillip realizes that the spinning ride of his unbearable vertigo has dissipated, and other than the fact that evening has fallen into night, he feels relatively back normal.

In fact, there's a knock at the door of 19991 Thanatos Drive.

And what were the odds?
