Successful Publications and Financial Gains

The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey

Profit: [Redacted, though it can be inferred that sales here were astronomical] Notes: Created significant gains for the subsidiary and its parent company. A multi-modal, multi-work franchise, including multiple ongoing digital and physical adaptations, all of which are vertically integrated within the work's own fractal rhizomatic structure itself. A massive work which has contributed substantially to the company's peak financial period, and which will continue to create a profit for the parent company, Skingraft Publishing, for the foreseeable future into infinity. As Malt Gibsey iconically stated, "The Wonderful World of Gibsey will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world."
