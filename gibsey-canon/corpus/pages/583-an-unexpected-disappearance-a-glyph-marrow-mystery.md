For all he knows they've killed him.

They killed Glyph.

Sent an alligator to get him.

Drowned.

Who knows?

All that water and all that color.

What did it all mean?

The shifting of the colors in the painting made him think of synesthesia.

He wondered if maybe Glyph struggled with that idea?

He did have a strange relationship to words, after all?

It seemed possible.

It's strange, how colors are both concrete and abstract aren't they? Both nouns and adjectives, subjects and objects? Wouldn't surprise him if Glyph mixed them up at times, here and there, like he did so many other things. Like Stillman did.
