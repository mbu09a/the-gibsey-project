Glyph starts to tear up, as well, at least as much as they can. They just aren't used to letting themselves flow as much as someone like Arieol does. Most of us aren't. Hell, even The Author isn't.

And come on, I was just going on about my own perceived abandonment. The Author's true self, yeah right! I'm fated to wander as much as anybody else. Trust me."
