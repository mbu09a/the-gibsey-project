You could smell it from afar, could already sense from the smell that it was going to be all liquidy, could feel it dripping before you even gripped the plastic and heaved it out of the can, just for the bottom to give out.

Forget it.

You could just say you did it and wait for Mom or Dad to notice you didn't do it, and yes, it's possible that they'd be furious about it, but also, they could understand what had happened and pity you, could be communicated to, could use it as a chance to teach a lesson.

Goddamn everything is thematic between parents and children, isn't it?

But parents don't learn shit, do they?

Whatever happened to all the lessons they learned?

Are they just locked away like all that's thrust backward into the Gibsey Vault?

Is it that you stop learning?

Does that happen too?

Is that one of the symptoms that comes with the same lack of feeling that also occurs regarding losing the joy of thrusting oneself down a small plastic enclosure towards the earth?
