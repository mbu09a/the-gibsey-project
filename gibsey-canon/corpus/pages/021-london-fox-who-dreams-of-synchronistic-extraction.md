Uncorked, it sends out waves of blood-red liquid to rush out onto the spotless counter and drip down onto her resort-home's various surfaces.

More and more chaos.

She trips, falling onto the title floor, crawling forward, pulling herself forward, forever forward, illuminated by nothing but the glow of SynchromyS.S.S.T.E.R.Y's screen.
