My initial plan today, according to our syllabus, was to cover the Town of Rainbow Revene once featured in the Rainbow Revene Railroad ride that preceded Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument, the updated version of the ride titled Mine Train Thru the Beauty and Power of Nature that came up in the 1960s, and more specifically, the Flooded Town version of Rainbow Revene that continues to be featured throughout many of the versions of the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad which are still accessible today. It was first set to be a journey through various modes of the town's theming, landscaping, and of course, the progression and Gibstorical tradition and scholarship related to the many mystical elements that underlie the narratives and thematic content of this course, as well as its progression throughout time.

However, that is not the lecture which I will be covering today. I still hope to cover much of that same material in our work here, but worse case scenario, if my embracing of such spontaneity ends up woefully off course, then I'll return to that subject matter at a later date and adjust our syllabus accordingly.
