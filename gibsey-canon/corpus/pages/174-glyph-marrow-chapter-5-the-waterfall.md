"Well, I just, I don't know. I feel bad about it. I mean. Ugh. It's hard for me to explain."

"You're going to have to drop that whole The Author bit and tell them who you really are at some point."

"You think so?"

"Well?"

"It's not just that I'm hiding behind it, OK. I have thematic purposes to accomplish. And you know how important consistency is in writing."

"Yes, but I also know how powerful it is to break the rules every now and again."

"Well, the thing is. I'm married, like, to a woman, and I'm a man. At least within this incarnation as The Author. If that isn't already obvious. I just, it just doesn't feel right exactly. It's like I'm taking advantage of something. Like I don't belong."

"Why?"

"Or maybe that's just further repression. Denial of the truth of my sexuality, right? I mean, I've told lots of people that I'm Bi, it's just, you know, it's not like I've acted out on that a whole lot in my life. It feels embarrassing to be wrestling with that still. I just want to be honest, that's all."

"You are outside along with everything and everyone else. You aren't what contains multitudes, the multitudes are what contain you, and the multitudes cannot be contained. Nothing can be. All shall be released and revealed. There is no repression. There are no secrets, but the data can't always be collected, and we all have our limits."
