And the company continues reading the tablets, and of course Emir gets all weepy and moved each time, of course he does, reaching a section that says they can take all they desire since they've been clever enough to enter the city, but to not steal the gems from the body of the damsel for it covers her shame, and if they do, they will destroy themselves by doing so.

And then the frame story-

Fuck it, he skips it.

They pack everything up, Emir weeping all the while, and Talib comes to him and is basically like, "Why can't we take the jewels and gems from off the damsel? She's dead? What's she going to do with them? What shame is it hiding from her? She isn't even alive? We have more of a right to it than she does!"

And so he decides to go and get the jewels from her, and when he does, oh yeah, of course, his head is cut clean off.

Yep, well, he could've seen that coming from a mile away.

Too bad Talib didn't.

And so they load everything up and continue onward-oh yeah, cause they still haven't gotten the Jinns that were put in those vessels yet, that's right-and they travel for a month until they reach these mountains with these black people living in them--oh, yep, they've make it to where they were supposed to make it to, that's right. Or maybe he didn't read this far before? He can't remember?-and it's very similar to the story about Talib's grandfather from the very beginning. This king comes to them who can speak their language, but woah-this didn't happen before?

The king asks them if they're men or jinn?

That's weird?
