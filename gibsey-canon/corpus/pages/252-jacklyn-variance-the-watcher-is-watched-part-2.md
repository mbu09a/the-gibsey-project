At the start of the scene, Bambino is falling in love with spring, and who can help but be entranced by the new, even if one tells oneself one isn't? And because of this love, Bambino wanders. And in this way, does the scripture imply that it's Bambino's wandering that causes her own mother's death, this wandering itself being a form of detachment, just as spring itself is a form of detachment from winter?

No, this observation would be an absurdity.

It's Bambino's innocence, even ignorance with which the audience identifies. The audience, be them children or adults-the boundary between the two, especially during this scene, while watching the loss of Bambino's mother, dissolving-and like all cyclical scriptures or Gibseyan classics, existing beyond time, and what is it to be a child or adult aside from a marker of time? How traumatic to have one's identity collapse, and so no wonder the brain compensates or confronts?

Audiences can't help but see themselves in Bambino.

All are detached and attached, the most detached and the most attached, the neglected and cared for, and even one's own response to such treatment, or trauma, itself, is arbitrary.
