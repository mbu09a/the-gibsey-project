Wait.

Oh, no.

I have to get off the balcony before Gillespie notices I'm out here.

I'll think of you like this, or think to you like this, again, in the next volume.

When I have more time to think.

Well, I have to go back and pretend to be reading either an author's preface or The Author's Preface on Gibsey to hide the fact that I'm snuck out here.

Ever read anything like what you're reading now before?

It's pretty interesting.

Helps me to pass the time, anyway.

Take care.

I'll think of you, or to you again, real soon, I promise.

Who knows, maybe I already have, before all this, and you just never?

After all, if I did, how would you ever know for sure?

And if I did, and always had, could you even stop me?

It's already too late.

And it's been too late.

Forever.
