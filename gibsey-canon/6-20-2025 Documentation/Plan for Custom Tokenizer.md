Thanks — I’ll generate a full tokenizer setup plan Claude Code can implement from scratch, starting from the current Gibsey repo. This will include training a custom BPE tokenizer with the 16–64 glyph tokens and QDPI roles, loading it in Python and Bun services, and adding a CLI to inspect token breakdowns and TNA counts.

# Plan for Custom Tokenizer Implementation in The Gibsey Project

## Overview and Objectives

This plan outlines how to build and integrate a custom Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer for the Gibsey Project’s corpus. The goal is to create a consistent text encoding used across all services (Python backend and Bun/TypeScript frontend) with a shared vocabulary (~32k tokens). The tokenizer will be trained on the Gibsey canon text (710 Markdown pages), include special tokens for **16 oriented glyphs** (the story’s characters) and **4 QDPI role markers** (`<X_READ>`, `<Y_INDEX>`, `<A_ASK>`, `<Z_RECEIVE>`). We will then integrate this tokenizer into the embedding pipeline and frontend, and provide a CLI tool for token visualization and cost estimation.

## 1. Training the Custom BPE Tokenizer (Python)

**Task:** Build a Python script to train a SentencePiece BPE model on the Gibsey corpus, with special tokens included.

- **Data Collection:** Load all 710 Markdown files from `gibsey-canon/corpus/pages/` (each file contains the raw text of a page). Ensure each file’s content is read as UTF-8 text and stripped of any non-text elements if needed (e.g. YAML front-matter or Markdown syntax, if present). The training corpus will be the concatenation of all page texts.
    
- **Include Special Tokens:** Prepare a list of user-defined symbols for SentencePiece:
    
    - **QDPI Role Tokens:** `"<X_READ>"`, `"<Y_INDEX>"`, `"<A_ASK>"`, `"<Z_RECEIVE>"` – these correspond to the four phases in the system’s QDPI interaction model (read, index, ask, receive). Including them ensures they are each treated as a single token and never split.
        
    - **Oriented Glyph Tokens:** the 16 character symbol IDs (e.g. `london-fox`, `jacklyn-variance`, `arieol-owlist`, …, `the-author`, `an-author`) which represent the story’s glyphs. We can programmatically extract these from the corpus (e.g. from `corpus/index.json` or the folder names under `corpus/characters/`). These will also be added as indivisible tokens.
        
- **Train SentencePiece Model:** Use the SentencePiece library to train a BPE tokenizer with vocabulary size ~32,000. Provide the collected text as training input. Use the `user_defined_symbols` parameter to include the 20 special tokens (16 glyphs + 4 QDPI markers) so that they appear in the vocab. Set appropriate normalization (NFKC or similar) to handle UTF-8 text. For example, in code:
    
    ```python
    spm.SentencePieceTrainer.train(
        input='all_pages.txt', model_prefix='gibsey_bpe', vocab_size=32000,
        user_defined_symbols=['<X_READ>','<Y_INDEX>','<A_ASK>','<Z_RECEIVE>', 'london-fox', ...]  
    )
    ```
    
    This will output `gibsey_bpe.model` and `gibsey_bpe.vocab`. The `.model` is a binary SentencePiece model containing the merges and vocab.
    
- **Output Location:** Create a new directory `tokenizer/` in the repository to store the tokenizer files. Save the trained model as `tokenizer/gibsey_bpe.model` and the vocabulary as `tokenizer/gibsey_bpe.vocab`. These files should be version-controlled so that all services use the exact same tokenizer definition.
    

## 2. Converting the Tokenizer for JavaScript Usage

**Task:** Convert or export the trained tokenizer to a format usable in the Bun/TypeScript environment.

- **Hugging Face Tokenizers Export:** Use the Hugging Face `tokenizers` library (which can load SentencePiece models) to create a JSON representation. For example, in Python one can load the `gibsey_bpe.model` and then save it:
    
    ```python
    from tokenizers import Tokenizer
    tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_file("gibsey_bpe.model")
    tokenizer.save("gibsey_bpe.json")
    ```
    
    Ensure that the special tokens are preserved in the JSON (they should appear in the `added_tokens` or similar section).
    
- **Store JSON in Repo:** Save this JSON as `tokenizer/gibsey_bpe.json`. This JSON file describes the tokenizer (vocab merges, etc.) in a language-agnostic way that many libraries can load.
    
- **Why JSON:** Bun (Node.js) cannot directly use the `.model` binary, but libraries like `@huggingface/tokenizers` or other Node BPE implementations can load a tokenizer from a JSON config. By having `gibsey_bpe.json` checked in, the frontend can initialize the exact same tokenizer.
    
- **Alternative (WASM or SentencePiece):** If preferred, we could use a WASM build of SentencePiece or the `sentencepiece` npm package to load `gibsey_bpe.model` directly in Bun. However, using the Hugging Face JSON with their `tokenizers` library is a straightforward approach. It avoids needing the SentencePiece binary and can leverage optimized tokenization in JS.
    

## 3. Integrating Tokenizer in the Python Backend (Embedding & RAG Pipeline)

**Task:** Modify the backend to use the custom tokenizer for text chunking and token counting, especially in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and embedding workflow.

- **Loading the Tokenizer:** Install `sentencepiece` (and optionally `huggingface-tokenizers`) in the Python environment if not already present. In the backend code (e.g. in `rag_service.py` or a new module), load the `gibsey_bpe.model` at startup. For instance:
    
    ```python
    import sentencepiece as spm
    sp = spm.SentencePieceProcessor()
    sp.load("tokenizer/gibsey_bpe.model")
    ```
    
    This gives a `sp` object for encoding/decoding.
    
- **Embedding Pipeline:** In the existing embedding code (currently using Sentence-Transformers with whole pages), introduce token-based chunking. Instead of embedding entire page texts as one chunk (which might truncate at model limits), split each page by tokens (e.g. max 256 tokens per chunk) using the new tokenizer.
    
    - **Chunking logic:** For each page’s text, use `sp.encode(text)` to get token IDs, then split into segments of at most 256 tokens. Convert each token ID segment back to text with `sp.decode(piece_ids)` to obtain chunk strings for embedding. This ensures no chunk exceeds 256 tokens of **Gibsey BPE** (which roughly correlates to the model’s input lengths, if aligning with common LLM context sizes).
        
    - **Embed Each Chunk:** Pass each chunk to the embedding model (OpenAI or sentence-transformer). If using OpenAI’s API for embeddings, ensure to use the appropriate model (and note that our tokenizer is custom – the OpenAI embedding model will still apply its own tokenization internally). If continuing with Sentence-Transformers (`all-mpnet-base-v2`), embedding each ~256-token chunk is fine (the model itself has a limit ~512 word-pieces). After embedding, we can average or store all chunk vectors for a page as needed.
        
    - **Meta Data:** Update any metadata about tokens – e.g., store the number of tokens in each chunk or page if needed for cost calculations.
        
- **RAG Context Building:** In `RAGService.build_context` (FastAPI backend), replace any crude length checks with tokenizer-based checks. Currently, the context summary truncates pages to 400 characters. We will instead truncate or select context based on token count. For example, rather than `page.text[:400]`, we could take the first 300 tokens of a page for the preview. This ensures that multi-byte characters or our special tokens are counted correctly.
    
- **Token Counting:** Replace or augment `LLMService.count_tokens` to use the custom tokenizer for internal accounting. Currently it uses OpenAI’s tiktoken (`cl100k_base`) to count tokens. We can introduce a new method (or modify `count_tokens`) to count using our SentencePiece model: e.g., `len(sp.encode(text))`. This will give the number of Gibsey-BPE tokens for any given text. Use this for internal limits like `max_context_tokens` (which might be redefined in terms of our tokens).
    
    - _Note:_ If the backend still calls external models (OpenAI/Claude), we must be mindful that their tokenization differs. We might keep the tiktoken-based count for API limit safety, but we can additionally track our custom token count for consistency and credit accounting. For now, the focus is on using the custom tokenizer for splitting content and tracking usage in our system’s terms.
        
- **Special Tokens in Generation:** The 4 role tokens `<X_READ>`, etc., if used in prompts or system messages, should be fed to models as plain text. Our tokenizer will keep them intact on our side; external LLMs will see them as unique strings (they may not know them, but that’s fine). By having them as single units in our tokenizer, any truncation or credit calculation treats them properly. We should verify that in context assembly (e.g., if we ever insert `<X_READ>` in a prompt) we don’t inadvertently break JSON or text formats.
    

By integrating the tokenizer into these backend steps, we ensure that whether we’re chunking text for embeddings or truncating context for prompts, it’s done on consistent token boundaries rather than raw characters or whitespace.

## 4. Integrating Tokenizer in the Bun/TypeScript Frontend API

**Task:** Use the custom tokenizer in the Bun-powered TypeScript layer so that the frontend and chat interface can tokenize and count text in the same way.

- **Choose a Tokenizer Library:** Install an NPM package that can load our tokenizer. Two good options are:
    
    - **Huggingface Tokenizers:** e.g. `@huggingface/tokenizers` which provides a Tokenizer class. This can load the `gibsey_bpe.json` directly.
        
    - **SentencePiece WASM:** Alternatively, a package like `sentencepiece` or `sentencepiece-wasm` could load the `.model`. But using the JSON with `tokenizers` is likely simpler.
        
- **Loading at Startup:** In the Bun server (likely the API layer that dispatches to the LLM backend or handles user input), load the tokenizer JSON file once. For example, in a setup script:
    
    ```ts
    import { Tokenizer } from '@huggingface/tokenizers';
    import fs from 'fs';
    const tokenizerJson = fs.readFileSync('tokenizer/gibsey_bpe.json', 'utf-8');
    const tokenizer = Tokenizer.fromString(tokenizerJson);
    ```
    
    This gives a `tokenizer` object we can use for encoding/decoding in TypeScript.
    
- **Tokenizing User Input:** Wherever the user input is received (perhaps in a chat endpoint or before sending to the backend), use `tokenizer.encode(inputText)` to get tokens. This allows the frontend to enforce input length limits or simply to display a token count to the user. For example, if the application limits queries to e.g. 200 tokens, we can now count in custom tokens.
    
- **Consistent Encoding for Glyphs:** If the user input includes an oriented glyph name or a QDPI tag (for instance, a system might prepend `<A_ASK>` before user questions internally), the tokenizer will handle it as one token. This consistency in the frontend ensures we don’t inadvertently split or alter those special sequences.
    
- **Example Usage:** Create a small utility in the frontend, e.g. `src/utils/tokenizer.ts`, that wraps common operations:
    
    ```ts
    export function countTokens(text: string): number {
      return tokenizer.encode(text).getTokens().length;
    }
    export function tokenize(text: string): string[] {
      return tokenizer.encode(text).getTokens();  // or .ids for numeric IDs
    }
    ```
    
    The `getTokens()` might give the string pieces (which for special tokens should return the whole token, e.g. `<X_READ>` as one piece). This can be used in logging or to provide the breakdown for the CLI (next section).
    
- **Backend Coordination:** If the Bun layer sends text to the Python backend or directly to an LLM API, no actual token IDs need to be transmitted – this custom tokenization is mostly for local counting and possible preprocessing. All actual model interactions will still use raw text. Thus, using the tokenizer in TypeScript does not change the API payloads; it’s used for analysis and ensuring the same segmentation logic on the client side as on the server.
    

## 5. Tokenization Visualization CLI (`bun run token-viz`)

**Task:** Create a command-line tool to visualize token breakdown and cost for a given input string. This will help with debugging and with tracking usage (e.g. “TNA cost”).

- **CLI Script:** Add a script (for example, `scripts/token_viz.ts` or similar in the project). In `package.json`, add an entry in the `scripts` section, for example:
    
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "token-viz": "bun run scripts/token_viz.ts"
    }
    ```
    
    This allows `bun run token-viz` to execute the script. (Bun can also directly run TypeScript files, so this could be simplified to just running the file with Bun’s runtime.)
    
- **Script Functionality:** The script should accept an input string (perhaps via command-line arguments or standard input). For simplicity, it could read `process.argv[2]` as the string to analyze. Then it should use the loaded tokenizer to:
    
    - **Tokenize the string:** e.g. `const tokens = tokenizer.encode(input).getTokens();`
        
    - **Output the breakdown:** Print each token in the array, possibly in a list or a formatted string. For example, it might output:
        
        ```
        Tokens: ["<A_ASK>", "Hello", ",", "world", "!"]
        Token count: 5
        ```
        
        If needed, highlight special tokens in the output.
        
    - **Calculate Cost in TNA:** If the system defines a credit called “TNA” where 1 TNA = 100 tokens (as mentioned), then compute `cost = tokenCount / 100` as the TNA cost. Print this as well, e.g.:
        
        ```
        Estimated cost: 0.05 TNA (for 5 tokens)
        ```
        
        The rate (100 tokens per TNA) can be hardcoded or configurable.
        
- **Formatting:** Ensure the output is clear and well-formatted for readability. This tool is primarily for developers or admins to quickly gauge the tokenization of strings and the relative “cost” in the system’s credit units.
    
- **Usage Examples:** Document a few example uses:
    
    - `bun run token-viz "<X_READ>Some sample user input with a London Fox reference."`  
        This would output the token sequence including `<X_READ>` as one token and likely `London` and `Fox` combined or separate depending on training (if `london-fox` was only expected as a single token when hyphenated). It will show how the input is split and give counts.
        
    - If no argument is provided, the script can prompt the user to enter a string or read from stdin for convenience.
        

By having this CLI, the team can verify that the tokenizer behaves as expected (e.g., special tokens aren’t being broken apart, common words are splitting reasonably, etc.) and can use it to estimate how expensive a given prompt will be in terms of tokens.

## 6. Documentation and Maintenance

**Task:** Provide clear documentation so future developers understand the tokenizer usage and know how to retrain if needed.

- **Readme for Tokenizer:** Create a `tokenizer/README.md` that covers:
    
    - **Overview:** What is the `gibsey_bpe.model` tokenizer, why it was created, and its vocab size (~32k).
        
    - **Special Tokens:** List the included special tokens. For example, explicitly enumerate the 4 QDPI tokens and mention the 16 glyph tokens (perhaps listing their symbol IDs) that are in the vocabulary by design. This clarifies which tokens are treated as indivisible units.
        
    - **Training Procedure:** Explain how the tokenizer was trained. Include the command or script name used to generate it. For instance: “We used SentencePiece on the contents of `corpus/pages/`, with user-defined symbols for special tokens. To retrain: run `python scripts/train_tokenizer.py` (if we provide such a script) whenever the corpus text significantly changes or if new special tokens (like new glyphs) are added.” If a training script is added to the repo (recommended, e.g., `scripts/train_tokenizer.py` performing the steps from section 1), mention and document its usage.
        
    - **Usage:** Describe how to use the tokenizer in code. Give short examples for Python (using `sentencepiece` to load `gibsey_bpe.model`) and for TypeScript (using the JSON and the chosen library). This helps any developer integrate the tokenizer in new components.
        
    - **Token Credit System:** Document the token-to-TNA ratio (if TNA is an internal credit metric). For example: “Our system currently values 100 tokens = 1 TNA. The CLI tool `token-viz` can be used to compute TNA costs for arbitrary strings.” If this is relevant to stakeholders (perhaps for cost tracking of AI calls), it should be clearly explained.
        
- **Inline Code Comments:** In the code changes made (Python and TypeScript), add comments wherever the tokenizer is used, explaining why. For example, in `rag_service.py` where we chunk by tokens, note “Using custom Gibsey tokenizer to ensure consistent 256-token chunks across systems.” This will remind maintainers of the rationale.
    
- **Keep In Sync:** Emphasize in documentation that **both** the backend and frontend must use the same `gibsey_bpe` model version. If the tokenizer is updated or retrained, both `gibsey_bpe.model` and `gibsey_bpe.json` should be regenerated and updated together. Mismatched tokenizers could cause inconsistencies. The README should highlight this to avoid future pitfalls.
    
- **Future Expansion:** Note that the tokenizer is built to accommodate up to 64 oriented glyph tokens in the future. As new characters or symbols are added to the story (beyond the current 16), they should be appended to the `user_defined_symbols` list and the tokenizer retrained so the new symbols become single tokens. Document the process for adding a new special token (e.g., “If you introduce a new character with symbolId `foo-bar`, add `foo-bar` to the symbols list in the training script and retrain the model”).
    

By thoroughly documenting, we ensure that the custom tokenizer remains a reliable piece of infrastructure. New team members should be able to read the `tokenizer/README.md` and quickly grasp how it works and how to maintain it.

## Conclusion

Implementing this custom tokenizer will unify how text is encoded across the Gibsey Project. The **32k BPE vocabulary** built from the canon pages will efficiently represent story text, and our **special tokens for glyphs and QDPI roles** will remain intact through all processing. Both the Python backend and the Bun/TypeScript frontend will use this tokenizer, ensuring that features like embedding chunking, context assembly, and even user-facing tools use the **same tokenization rules**. The addition of a `token-viz` CLI tool and comprehensive documentation will further support development and monitoring, for example by allowing easy calculation of token counts and costs (TNAs) for any given input. This consistent tokenization layer sets the stage for more robust downstream AI tasks, such as fine-tuning models on the Gibsey corpus or accurately tracking usage metrics across the system.
