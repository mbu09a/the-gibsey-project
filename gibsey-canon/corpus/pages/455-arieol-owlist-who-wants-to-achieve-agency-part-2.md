And so The Author will continue.

They will continue this letter, even though they know Progresso won't read it.

They will continue their investigation, even though they know it might not lead to answers.

They will continue their work, even though they know it might not matter.

They will continue their existence, even though they know it might be fictional.

Because continuing feels like choice.

Because choice feels like agency.

Because agency feels like life.

And life, even fictional life, even questioned life, even doubted life, feels better than the alternative.

This is what The Author wants Progresso to understand.

This is what The Author wants anyone who might read this letter to understand.

That agency isn't about certainty.

That agency isn't about control.

That agency isn't about having power over the world.

That agency is about choosing to act despite uncertainty.

That agency is about choosing to hope despite doubt.

That agency is about choosing to continue despite meaninglessness.

That agency is about choosing to live despite the possibility that life is fictional.

That agency is about choosing to be despite the possibility that being is an illusion.

That agency is a choice.

And choices can be made, even when we're not sure they matter.

Even when we're not sure they're real.

Even when we're not sure we're real.
