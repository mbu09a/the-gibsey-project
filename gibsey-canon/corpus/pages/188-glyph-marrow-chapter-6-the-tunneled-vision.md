"Do you have any idea how difficult it is to make you get serious about anything?" Glyph asks, growing more concerned themselves.

"Don't remind me."

"So, uh, the um, the fairies." Arioel leans back, their hands shaking. The cigar's gone out, but they wait to light it and leave it as is, totally shaken. The air's gone clean out of them.

Gibseydamn, Arieol thinks to themselves. This son-of-a-bitch is much stronger than they thought. Whole weight of the world's on their fucking shoulders. Are they gonna make it?
