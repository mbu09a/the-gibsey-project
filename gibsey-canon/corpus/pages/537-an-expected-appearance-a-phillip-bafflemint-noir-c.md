As soon as he pulls out, all familiarity vacates.

All that orients him to the geography of his earth disappears.

And this sudden shift (or slip) doesn't feel due to any internal dizzy spell or vertigo that he could sense coming on, but instead feels rooted to the landscape which surrounds him.

And for a detective, one's sense of observational directionality is quite paramount, to say the very least.

Terror grips him.

He drives down streets which he doesn't recognize.

If anything, he could swear he was in a different place than before?

Was he?

It looks an awful lot like an American city from the Pre-Gibseyan era that he'd seen in documentaries and his text books growing up?

Was it some new attraction of Gibseyan design?

He continues driving down the street, which he notices is even more filled with traffic than even the average Gibsey World street usually was.

If he had entered some alternative world-one of some faceless and nameless author-wherever he was, the traffic was absolutely horrible, and people around him were driving like fucking maniacs.

What was wrong with these people?

This was supposed to be the most magical place on earth?
