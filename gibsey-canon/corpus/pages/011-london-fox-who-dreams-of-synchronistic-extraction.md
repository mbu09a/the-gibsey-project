London Fox is a hyper-successful, hyper-competent, hyper-well-dressed, and more than anything, hyper-rational business woman. Owner and head of multiple companies of her own creation, she's recently started a new advantageously venturous project with the objective of proving, once and for all, that Artificial Intelligent systems aren't conscious and never could be.

This projected objective of hers has led her to develop the chatbot Synchromy-S.S.S.T.E.R.Y (Short Story Simulator to Entertain Readers, Yearly) which, upon its conception, was to become the most sophisticated model of its kind. Upon setting this objective, she hadn't originally done so with the goal of achieving a singularitous near-apocalyptic post-human epoch. In fact, her goal was quite the opposite. She'd originally hoped that upon developing the most complex AI system in the field, and doing so while stripping all ghosts from its machinic machinations, that such asinine and ridiculous faiths could be laid to rest, forever.
