**An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery** **Chapter 6- The Tunneled Vision**

After hitting a trim brake and exiting another tunnel, the minecart hurtles forward toward The Second Ascent.

Glyph is still riding the ride.

Again, the cart tilts diagonally towards the sky, heading up the hill, tractor beam style.

Now, Glyph doesn't remember his ancient myths, so he obviously doesn't remember Apollo, and he especially doesn't remember the concept of imminence, how an entity wouldn't be thought of as separate from the world and would instead be considered as present within it-essentially, this could be thought of as a much earlier Gibstorical example of Glyph's own ailment, of mixing up the subject and the object, or to put it in even more contemporary terms: aliens aren't descending down upon us UFO-style, or ascending away from us to hide, yet again, amongst the stars; instead they are inside us, and we are the aliens of ourselves-however, he does remember how it feels when the sun hits your face, how when that column of brightness passes over you, how it fills you with such a fulfilling warmth and stillness, and so when it passes over him, as the cart climbs, he's filled with a temporary joy he hasn't yet experienced since the ride began, an exit, an escape.

And he loses himself, temporarily, at least.
