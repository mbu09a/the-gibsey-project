They always get to remain anonymous.

It's like Oren Progresso with his hands around your throat, trying to eat you alive as you struggle beneath him.

"Quit…quit…quit that! Quit squirming. Come on, come on! Please. Please! Just let me have a little bite."

"No, NO!"

Will Arieol Owlist achieve agency?

Arieol tries to struggle away, but Oren grabs at their hand, pulling it back, yanking Arieol's hand into his mouth with a quick gust of strength, snapping a fleshy tendon off into his jowls like a celery stick being slid into a wood-chipper.

In shock, Arieol whirls around, spinning out of Oren's grasp, screaming in pain.

Why had they loosened enough to allow Oren to even go this far?

It's like they knew deep down that this horrid CEO was bound to scarf down at least some part of them, so it was better a finger than their whole face, anything but the face, the mask, that was the surface which conveyed all of their various meanings, after all. It had to be protected, even concealed, forever concealed, hidden.

It goes without saying that blood starts spurting everywhere.

And there's no protecting it.
