Their time was like a child who didn't even care enough about their own father to even process that during their infancy, when he'd claimed he was just going off to buy a simple pack of Marlboro Reds, he'd instead shuffled off into the distance and out of their life, a child who didn't even care enough to even notice the absence, let alone the initial presence-it didn't even rattle around in the bingo machine of their brains, not even once.

And who got to have the excess time?

Who took it away?

But there are also other times, other times when Parlance forgets he's past his prime, forgets he's even forgetting, and like all memories, these memories are fleeting, and therefore become harder and harder to include within the code of the game he's been working on for so long but which he's spent so little time actually creating. And there are so many details he wants to get into the game.
