If he was found at the scene of the crime, even if he didn't say a word and even worse, even if he hadn't been the perpetrator of the shit, he'd suddenly become the shitter of the said shit, and therefore would be forced to become the author and creator of the greatest shit ever to be shat by a singular shitter.

And this possibility had terrified him.

However, upon reaching the safety outside, he realized that this terror could shift and could even be transformed.

His chuckling first started as he walked through the hallway back to his office.

And after this, he couldn't stop.

And It wasn't just the size, weight, and unflushable permanence of the thing that started him cackling in the parking lot all the way home, that had him choking on his cereal the next day, or that years later-working from home-that had him sitting at his work space, twirling his fingers through his hair, imagining how he could somehow get the story of the event into the game he was creating; it was how he alone had been the one to find it and how impossible it would be to communicate it to anyone else.
