From what I've laid out, it should be clear that the system which I 've been discussing in the recent passages of this Analysis Document is quite efficient, the truth of which has nearly become an objective reality itself, an entity, a corporation. Although all observations, since they are always made by individuals (or at least almost always), are nothing if not subjective, so I've chosen to insert myself subjectively here in order to make my own objectivity more definitive, as well as my intentions, my objectives. It is not the efficiency or inefficiency of our systems which is in question within this document, but instead, it is Parlance's individualized, differentiated inefficiency, his inability, yet again, to continue coding his game because more and more he's realized, or he's realizing, that there's an essential part of his game's story that's missing: his family.

Even games can tell narratives and create myths, after all, maybe even automatically so, before we've even created them, at least if they're based on rules that can be followed and recreated, remade, even before their time, structures waiting to animate form, to become form animated, like palaces of cumulative memory.

What is (and was) missing from Jack's imagined game was the concept and subject of family, and Jack's inability to include the concept of family wasn't only due to his inadequacies as a storyteller, but his inadequacies as a person, personal or professional.
