There's so much trauma that gets ignored, recreated, and analyzed, nearly every moment. Going to see a screening of the movie in a few minutes. I'm worried about what I'll find there. Every time I look I see something new. The terror isn't in not finding something. It's in finding too much.

(Exposition is given within the film as a possible window into Parlance's possible current emotional state that, for now, so early in the patterns of his unfolding, can only be inferred. But to return to the untitled attachment).

Jack Parlance sits at small hotel desk at Economy Room at The Gibsey Ecco Resort. Notebook on desk. Lamp on. Likely late evening. Writing. He begins to write.
