Bambino is soon to be left to mutter repeatedly that eternal phrase, "Mother?" within the layers of snow falling, as they push Bambino further and further into the background, making her (or him) more and more distant from the audience as they grow more and more attached to Bambino, and to Bambino's abandonment, the forced abandonment, of course, which is not caused by Bambino's agency, but a lack thereof, the snow ever falling, that frontal layering of its flurry, the chaos of snow, falling, creating layers within the layers, habitating accumulations of meaning, Bambino's continued wandering, "Mother," a singular noun used to pose the plurality of a question, a series of questions, falling, to question, to be questioned, to be forced to question one's own identification with one's own mother, not a misidentification, but a disidentification.

Poor, poor Bambino, fading backward, being pushed not just by the foregrounding snow, but by the liminal darkness of the dead winter trees, columns of age and maturity, here to temporarily dominate the frame and provide emphasis and meaning.
