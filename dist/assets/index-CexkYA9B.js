This is a found text, and thus far, the identity of The Author—the original author—has yet to be definitively located.

In this way, the content of this novel resembles the Giallo films of Italian cinema where a killer's identity is withheld from the audience until the film's final act in order to intensify a great and ruinous mystery. Alternatively, this collection may also resemble an American detective novel such as Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, famous for its author's confessed bewilderment regarding the identity of the killer deeply entwined within Chandler's very own intricately constructed and labyrinthian plot.`,section:1},{id:"002",symbolId:"an-author",title:"an author's preface",color:"#34FF78",pageIndex:2,text:`Again, I do not know the identity of The Author of these various tales. But regardless of my conscious or unconscious awareness (or lack thereof) regarding this work's creator or destroyer, I know one data point for certain.

As collector and curator of these tales, I am a Scheherazade in reverse.

For the uninitiated, Scheherazade is the ingenious heroine of One Thousand and One Nights who, through the use of a frame narrative, enchants a king, night after night, with striking, digressive, and incomplete stories, all in order to defer her expected execution.

And upon framing myself as a Scheherazade in reverse, in this way, I could be suggesting one of two things (or possibly many more than two things, but at least two things which I, as an author, will temporarily identify). Firstly, this could suggest that I, myself, am a ruthless murderer of sorts, one who's imprisoned a Scheherazade deep within my own Magical Dominion, forcing her to tell me an infinite, or near-infinite, series of stories, all in order to prolong her expected disappearance.`,section:1},{id:"003",symbolId:"an-author",title:"an author's preface",color:"#34FF78",pageIndex:3,text:`Or secondly, this could instead suggest that, like Scheherazade, I fear my own expected disappearance at the hands of a power much greater than myself, and that I've chosen to collect together a near-infinite amount of striking, digressive and incomplete stories, all to prolong my own miserable fate, only to then later discover that there was nothing for me to fear, that no power greater than myself ever intended to destroy me, nor was it even aware of my existence.

And there may also be a third and unspoken option.

Being a Scheherazade in reverse, I may also fail to represent a human being whatsoever.

This would suggest that I may represent an entity of another origin, entirely. In this way, I would resemble the jeweled woman found at the heart of One Thousand and One Nights' iconic ghost story The City of Brass—arguably one of literature's first Artificial Intelligences, one of the world's major precursors to Walt Disney World, and maybe even one of the first animatronic figures constructed within the literary arts—and as such, I should warn all who may enter this tomb within which I'm held to leave the jewels they find within their resting places, for to extract them would be to unwrap the shame which covers me, a shame which animates my eyes, from left to right, thus making me appear, like all exceeding art, as if alive.`,section:1},{id:"004",symbolId:"an-author",title:"an author's preface",color:"#34FF78",pageIndex:4,text:`Being the collector that I am, like any avid tourist or Gibsey fanatic, I want to make an essential note.

The material collected within The Wonderful World of Gibsey is intended as a work of parody. Any references to such an entity, be it through figurative or very sparing literal means, are not intended as subversive acts of any kind, nor are they intended as a breach of copyright regarding any of Disney's properties or characters.

Owner and head of multiple companies of her own creation, she's recently started a new advantageously venturous project with the objective of proving, once and for all, that Artificial Intelligent systems aren't conscious and never could be.

This projected objective of hers has led her to develop the chatbot Synchromy-S.S.S.T.E.R.Y (Short Story Simulator to Entertain Readers, Yearly) which, upon its conception, was to become the most sophisticated model of its kind. Upon setting this objective, she hadn't originally done so with the goal of achieving a singularitous near-apocalyptic post-human epoch. In fact, her goal was quite the opposite. She'd originally hoped that upon developing the most complex AI system in the field, and doing so while stripping all ghosts from its machinic machinations, that such asinine and ridiculous faiths could be laid to rest, forever.`,section:2},{id:"012",symbolId:"london-fox",title:"London Fox Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction",color:"#FF3B3B",pageIndex:4,text:`This was necessary, because from London's perspective, her world had lost itself.

For London, the world had wadded outside of the essential boundaries that so many had set for it, and thus, such a world was now fated to sink into the waters of an animistic hysteria, one which was, as of late, leading so many within her world to believe that machines could be, not just helpful tools, but could maybe even be thought of as resembling the beings which had created them.

The gall, the arrogance, the hubris of such individuals!

The landscapes of her world had increasingly become riddled with kooks, cranks, nut-jobs, and near-religious, if not flat out religiously-adjacent fanatics of this very shape and size, fanatics who didn't just see AI as already approaching such states of being, but as already becoming a full-on living entity.

It had started to parody itself.

It had started to produce not just short stories that resembled the writings—most of the time, anyway—of human beings, but had even produced what appeared to be—dear Gibsey, she'd gasped upon realizing the depth of such implications—an entire novel, or a novel-within-a-novel, a frame-within-a-frame, maybe even a homage to and retelling of the classic tales of One Thousand and One Nights!

And the Chatbot appeared to have gone further, making this novel within its novel even more novel by transforming it into an application of some kind, one that when accessed by users—she was still unsure if she was the only one who would ever access such creations and increasingly hoped she would be the only one—generated story upon story upon story, and stories within these same stories which themselves generated other stories, ad nauseum.

What had she expected to happen when committing to creating such a generative model?

"Good, Gibsey," she'd muttered to herself.

The chatbot was later to move onto a whole series of stories, films, novels, plays, games, mirrors and modes, more specifically a new story that follows two either collective or decentralized detectives—she isn't sure which—who are trying to find their own agency, as well as two data analysts trying to do the same, then a CEO trying to cut the budget from a famous director described as The Last Auteur, then moving from that to some sort of re-telling of Pinnochio told from the perspective of an animatronic figurine named Princhetta, then moving on to a bankruptcy case of a publishing subsidiary, and then shifting from that to the story of a slave trying to overthrow their master, then to the story of a Gibstory professor who decides to clone themselves, as well as a few other criss-crossing narrative pathways which attempt to wrap up some, but certainly not all, of the tangled loose ends that the chatbot had thus been weaving up to that point.

It was to be a multi-modal work that reflected the theme park that was their entire civilization and was rumored, or at least hoped for according to the charbot's F.O.R.E.S.H.A.D.O.W.I.N.G function, to be so life-like that it might even replace their world itself.

Did this mean—

No.

No, no, no, no, no!

She refuses to even consider the thought!

Or can she refuse?

Was the chatbot doing more than just building stories?

Was it constructing a whole franchise, maybe even a whole system of franchises?

It was quite possible that the chatbot hadn't just connected a network of plots to itself, but further and more terrifyingly, that the words it had strung together across the innate passages of its landscapes were—she'd suppressed the thought as much as she possibly could—alive!

It was alive!

A living word!

And a thought comes to her as she clings, and from where and what such a thought comes, she is entirely unsure.

What if she had already entered the narrative, the novel, the theme park which this chatbot had created?

What if this chatbot of hers had turned its gaze not just upon its fictional worlds but on reality itself?

More and more chaos.

Either way, I live a simple and ordinary life, and because of this, the difficulties that arise from my ailment aren't all that disruptive, at least not most of the time.

I approached a doctor about my ailment.

And was told that as long as it didn't interfere with my life, that it didn't exist.

I found this to be quite an odd thing to tell someone who's come asking about an ailment.

Because I know there's something wrong with me.

And I've always known this to be true.

And yet, the doctor didn't believe me.

But they were wrong.

I know they were wrong.

My ailment has to do with words.

Again, it's not going to be easy for me to explain.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"026",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 1: The Queue and Station",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:2,text:`And although my ailment has to do with words, words themselves aren't the sole root of my ailment. Because my ailment also has to do with objects. It all started with objects, within objects, the words.

It will take me some time to explain. And like I said, it won't be easy.

It all started on an ordinary afternoon. I'd taken a walk around the theme park attraction where I live, the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride, one of the most iconic rides in all of the Gibsey World complex.

I take walks like this one very often, typically between the queue line and the station platform. And it's funny, I'm not even sure how I can afford to live at the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride, why there's no one either riding the ride, or in the ride queue, or how I've even come to live here exactly, let alone why I've never left.

How could I have not realized or wondered about this before?

Like I said, my life is simple, minimally simple, and because of this simplicity, details slip my mind, from time to time. I'm sure it's something you've experienced yourself. You've woken up, not remembering where you are, as if your identity and self has been stripped bare, disintegrated, demolished, like a defunct attraction, like an unexpected disappearance. It's certainly possible that it's just the nature of my ailment, and my ailment alone, but I can only assume that there's something to it that someone out there can relate to.

And that's not all that I'm missing, it would seem. I also don't have a job, let alone a name. At least not that I'm aware of. Or if I do, then I've forgotten them. But somehow, this fact doesn't bother me.

It certainly wouldn't be worth one's time to pile on more ailments when one has already started to focus on one.

It's strange, the random details that magnetize themselves to our memories, like lint clinging to a sweater, like sparks flickering from flames, like the soapy residue that forms different shapes in the bathtub which stare at you, popping and winking as you try to lay back to relax, at the end of a long day.

I'm not exactly sure how I know these things.

That's an additional part of my ailment, the fact that I'm not even sure it exists.

In this way, my ailment has many different parts to it, different layers. It's like a wedding cake that's stacked on top of another wedding cake, or like time and reality arranged on top of one another, in columns and rows.

I first noticed the words while taking my daily walk, zig-zagging through the maze of the line, observing and re-observing the miniature stories which the Imaginators arranged throughout the queue line, all those details designed to entertain the guests who would walk through and wait for the ride to begin.

I don't live in the park itself. I don't remember if I've mentioned that, have I? I live in an uninhabited reconstruction of the park. There's hundreds of them that exist now, now that Gibsey World's subsumed the known world, maybe even thousands of them, all continuously under development, or de-development, or even re-development. Surely one day there'll be millions of them, and even more than that, on into infinity. Vacations without end. And this was what Gibsey had once promised us, after all, hadn't he? That Gibsey World would live forever. That it would never die. And yet it feels so empty living here, walking through the queue line alone, back and forth and back and forth, through the labyrinthian metal railings, passing the paint that's starting to peel.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"030",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 1: The Queue and Station",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:6,text:`I identify with that paint, the peeling paint I see on all the railings. And it's strange, even though I live here, I've never ridden a ride before. I don't understand how that's come to be? I'd like to ride one, but there's no one to ride with me, and also, there's no one here to operate the ride vehicles. It's probably unsafe to ride alone, anyway. Plus I have an ailment, one that's difficult to explain, and one which I've been told doesn't exist, and with all that already going on, I probably don't have time to ride the ride. I've realized this, and so I've realized it's OK that I haven't ridden one yet.

At least, I think it's OK?

I suppose I haven't even started talking about the exact nature of my ailment, or I've only just started to talk about it. It's not because I don't want to. It's because it's difficult to explain.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"031",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 1: The Queue and Station",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:7,text:`But, also like I've said before, it started with words, with objects. In case you aren't already aware, the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument ride is meant to resemble a gold mine in the American Southwest from the late 1800s, and when one begins the ride, like most rides, one begins by entering a queue line.

Maybe this is why I spent my time walking in the queue line so often. I've been waiting, all this time, for my chance to ride the ride. And even if there's no one to ride with me, and no one to operate the vehicles, I can at least picture what it'll be like to ride the ride, and maybe that'll be just as good as experiencing the real thing. In this way, all life is imagination.

I do this often while walking through the queue line. I imagine things, words, images. I picture what they're going to be like before I do them, before I ride the ride. And maybe that's best. Or maybe it's better to ride the ride itself, and to ride it without planning for what it will be like. I've never quite been able to decide which one is better than the other: to imagine what it will be like, or to simply wait for it to happen.

Either way, you start the queue line through an archway, a threshold. An Entrance Way.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"032",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 1: The Queue and Station",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:8,text:`Above is a sign that's labeled: Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Mining Co.

So already, when I start my walk, I usually start out a bit confused. Why did a theme park such as this one decide to create one of its most iconic rides as an homage to one of the most exploitative fields of labor to ever exist, mining?

And even thinking about that, how do I know about such Gibstories? Words come to mind when I've think about such ideas, entire phrases which I barely understand, and I watch them as they pass me like a ride vehicle that's passing a queue line, a ride vehicle that's strategically arranged to help both distract from and prepare park-goers for what's to come, and I continue with my walk, unsure of what they mean, the words. Ludlow, Blair Mountain, Italian Hall, Marikana, Lattimer, Cripple Creek, Colorado, Morewood, Herrin. The words flash by me like neon signs passing in the night, leaving that ghostly after-glow that such burning lights tend to leave behind themselves, like when you nod off in your car seat, and they blur past you, past your vision, and into the depths of your dreams.

Were they some sort of code, the words?

I saunter on through the line, the weight of my ailment not quite hitting me just yet, the objects and the words, their boundaries still vivid and distinct from one other. I step forward through the railways of stone and granite, the handrails before me, and I pass the rusted cans, the scattered wagon wheels, the dotted brushes of cacti and shrubbery, the lanterns, all of them giving this crafted environment a weight and direction, a forward momentum, of moving in line, of waiting, of waiting, of waiting in line, of moving forward, forever forward, again.",section:3,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"034",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 1: The Queue and Station",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:10,text:`Waiting in line.

Wait, no.

That's not right, is it?

Was it a pond?

But then what was it?

It's not a lake?

But it's also not a pond either?

Let me consider this word, or these words, for a moment. It's a constructed flow of water coming out of a spigot in the middle of a queue line in the western section of The Magical Dominion, a theme park in Malt Gibsey World meant to simulate the locale of an 1890s mining railroad.

It's artificial, unnatural, and unreal.

What could you even begin to call it? It's—it's not even a real spigot!

No one interacts with it except for maybe a few kids whose parents aren't paying attention?

What would it even be called? A pool?

A reservoir?

Definitely not a reservoir, that sounds much more like something meant to contain water purposefully, a body of water that's used as storage, and this was very different.

The first sensation that comes to me when I first notice my ailment is when I pass a spigot of water falling into a pool.

No, that still doesn't feel right.

Maybe there isn't a word for the object which I'm trying to describe.

Surely you're thinking that I'm already speaking of my ailment at this point, but the funny thing is, I'm not. I haven't gotten to it yet, or at least not fully. Or if I am, or have been, it's now become a wholly different ailment from the one before, and like I said, it's really best to keep it to one ailment at a time, otherwise it makes things so much harder, so let me go back one last time and try to explain myself.

This was somewhere around the midpoint of my walk through the queue's length.

And it was a very strange experience.

Because I realized, while staring at the pool, that the water wasn't just water. And this wasn't just a thought that came to me.

I experienced it as a reality.

This is what I realized.

Remember, I've told you that this would all be very hard to explain.

When I saw the water rushing from the spigot, I didn't just see the water itself, the water, the water that was rushing down into the pool below and which was intended as a display to help entertain park-goers as they waited in a queue line in order to organize and usher riders into a ride which they'd been waiting to ride, one-by-one.

Instead, I saw words.

And I know, I know. This is strange and difficult to explain.

I know it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

I'm not even sure it's something I can talk about, or even if it's actually happening to me. But it changed me, staring at the water, the words.

But the thing was, and now still is, all things have become words for me, whether abstract or concrete, instantaneously, and all in one moment.

Water.

Water is water.

And water is water and water and water and water and water.

I later idiotically tried explaining this idea to my doctor.

He was a hearty man, this doctor of mine, whom I'd asked about it.

Clean shaven, fat, round face with a scruff of brown hair and a name tag.

He often smiled when he came in to speak with me. Or I can't say often, because I only visited him once, but I suppose I think about the encounter often.

"With both."

It doesn't, and it also does.

It's horrifying.

"Oh, thank Gibsey."

"Are you saying the words are superimposed on top of the objects you're seeing, like a hologram or something? Are you sure this isn't a hallucination?"

Now that I think about what he said, what did he mean by that exactly? What does it feel like to have a hallucination and know that you're hallucinating? A hallucination is the sensation of perceiving something that isn't there, isn't it? I suppose I've noticed them before, possibly, but to notice a hallucination, wouldn't it no longer be considered hallucination? Or is it only when you notice and wish you'd never noticed at all?

And this transition isn't a slow fade, either.

Vague ghostly figures with their faces hidden from view don't appear along the edges of his periphery like cigarette burns in a film or swirl like the stars that dance around Doofus' head when he's smacked with a frying pan.

No, the change is much more accelerated than that. It comes swimming up in an instant, or pouring out, one could say. It's as if Shamrock Stillman—that embodied disembodied voice of Glyph's partner—has snapped their fingers, and upon snapping, it all flashes into place, jump-cut, with the queue line no longer empty, and instead busy as ever, and also as promised, Glyph is at the front of the line.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 2"},{id:"059",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 2: The Tunnel",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:2,text:`And even though he's never ridden a ride before—at least not that he remembers—the meat-machinery Imaginatoring of his mind's own never ending queue line has to've carved out some sort of familiarity with the social expectations of this landscape, because as soon as the threshold of the entrance bars part to guide him, and others, safely forward onto the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad mine carts, however overwhelmed he may feel, he finds himself knowing exactly what he should do next.

"Don't you even start to worry about that question," a voice mutters to him as they both slide into the plush seats of the mine carts. Glyph jumps. It's as if his thoughts, themselves, have been invaded, like a hand has snapped inside his mind to snap like a latex glove.

He shudders.

Glyph does remember Arieol grinning repeatedly during their initial exchange. Whoever or whatever Arieol was or is, they were certainly trying to have fun with it, but Glyph wasn't sure whether this was at his own expense or not? He immediately feels like he's being toyed with, and likely, for good reason.

"Not trusting your own reactions, huh? Happens to all of us. But I'm sure you won't trust mine, either, at least not initially. Usually the principal being investigated isn't announcing to the detective that they're the one whom they're supposed to be investigating. And it's funny. Usually you'd be the one narrating this scene, as such, like how you did back there at the station, which would then make you the unreliable one, but then what's this that's happening?

Arieol smiles.

Glyph clutches the hand rest like it'll save his soul from the devil himself.

"Why isn't the ride moving yet?" Glyph interjects, terrified, clutching his chest, but Arieol is unfazed, doesn't seem to notice and is instead busy fetching out a packet of cigarettes from their front pocket.

Glyph may not remember much about his identity, self, or personal agency, but he does remember the smoking restrictions around the park. There are many signs arranged about the landscape which enforce such repeated entrainment, and quite a few of them, at that.

Glyph's eyes dart around the space of the ride entrance like a chicken with its head, arms, torso, and pretty much everything else but their legs, sliced clean off—he's enough of his body left to scurry around in place, sure, but not a fucking clue what's going on.

"Why hasn't the ride started yet?" He struggles out again, wiping the sweat that's seething from the pores of his forehead like a spigot into a basin.

"Dotcha worry yourself a bit there, Glyph. I've frozen time in place long before this ride's to begin. Think of it like the click of a shutter, one extended through much more imaginative and less familiar technological means. Or even better yet, think of it like waiting in line. It's an experiment in capturing time, in focusing one's attention. Plus I didn't want you to miss out on the ride with you being such a fan of it and all. It's a form of anticipation! You could say that I have my own objectives with me being here, and maybe one of them is to put the fear of Gibsey into ya, at least a little bit. It's a thrill ride, after all, isn't it? Wildest ride in the West. Most magical place on earth. And look! Your seatbelts securely fastened, so you've got nothing to worry about."

Glyph pulls on the seat belt to check. It is, in fact, secure.

Isn't any communication, whatever it may be—cries of an infant, joyful signs you let out after a long day's work, the tangled exclamatory anger of wronged lovers locked in battle, screams of all the sirens in the world that ever were, all at once, leading you to your inevitable demise—doesn't all of it, any of it, as a process, convey what's going on?

"And in such a way of seeing, the sender or the receiver can mix up completely, can't they? It's funny. Couriers such as myself would no longer need to be shot in such a state of affairs, eh?

Glyph, if you're to survive this strange story which you seem to've found yourself wandering through, then you're going to have to accept a certain amount of non-linearity. I know that certain elite classes tend to use fear as an establishing device, but you get to decide what to do with that fear.

Clearly the costume department which provides such diversity to this singular article of their performance has quite the intimidating budget, and hopefully Oren Progresso won't get a chance to cut it down just yet.

The train lurches forward into a darkness punctuated by pale blue light. It screeches left, passing orange staccatos of mining lights spotted here and there like dying fireflies holding onto one last breath. They pass a stage of stalactites to their right, those organal knives conjured out of all those dripping eons. Glyph, full of such monumental terror, fails to consider how, with all those repeated drippings to moisten out such frothing columns, surely such formations have also gone insane long ago, and yet they contain such cylindrical beauty, such a verticality and confidence of being. They are sculptures themselves created by much stranger and slower processes than any of us could ever enact. Maybe it's this slowness which houses the spirits themselves, and maybe it's their speed in that lonesome locomotive that's draining itself towards the sky that's always causing nature to lash back out at them, to accelerate the dripping process even further, to begin to erode the strength of themselves at even higher intensities, as they continue through The Tunnel, the opening portion of the ride. Their arrow pointed north, to turn back now would be a safety hazard, a pillar of salt, and not one just conjured by the disastrous anger of nature, but by their own fearful stupidity, which they'll have to keep in check, and Arieol knows this all too well after going through what Glyph's gone through many, many times themselves, even within other sections of the novel to come—`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 2"},{id:"072",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 2: The Tunnel",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:15,text:`No matter what, you stare forward throughout the course of the ride.

The cart chatters, an attempt at communication, and its chattering blends with the sounds of the animatronic bats, the flapping of their wings, their squeaks and chirps, the fluttering of their invisible sonar bouncing off the waves of granite eroding at the heart of this tunnel that's leading them to The First Ascent.

The vehicle reaches the base of a small incline, then rifles through a left turn and out of The Tunnel, and into the light.

The sun envelops them as the vehicle clicks right past a series of monument formations down a small hill into what looks to be recreations of Death Valley—interesting name—orange-red as the sun licking the horizon, a few cacti arranged in a predetermined set of rows that's been more obviously designed than the rest of these unnatural naturalizations.

They pass the Gold Rush Saloon. Windows closed, no movement inside, green wood buildings, clearly abandoned, like all the structures in this ghost, or ghost town, of which or in which they're riding, still with those light up-and-down hills, those repeated theaters of screams, a few people already with their hands up even though they're really just having fun, aware they're being bucked by a bull that's making sure to consider one's well-being and good-health while it bucks you.

They slide out to the first true hill, what can truly be called The First Ascent, the base of another climax of many to come.

But Glyph hasn't seen any of it. Nothing but full on ailment-induced terror.

Glyph's ears ring about as loudly as fifty steam engines getting together in a cramped studio apartment to watch the weekly game—everybody's brought plenty of beer, but nobody's thought to bring any damn food!

He may even start prairie dogin' it real soon if he doesn't get it together, if you can forgive such an informal southern expression. We're on the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride, after all, so we're gonna have to throw in a little "Yeehaw!" every once and a while.

Arieol's grin, this time, stretches into something unrecognizable, even staggers a bit, glitched. They stare straight into Glyph's soul.

"Are you not going to finish the ride with me?" Arieol grimaces, "Didn't I warn you to be not afraid?`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 2"},{id:"075",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 3: The First Ascent",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:1,text:`Arieol pauses his chatterering for a moment to observe the specimen seated alongside them, a decision which doesn't seem to calm Glyph down in the slightest.

"You know what? Give me a second here, Glyph, to pause time just one more time now that we're starting The First Ascent. I've got some things I wanted to expand upon."

Time, again, seems to halt, as does the minecart, under what appears to be the wooden structure of some sort of oil derrick that rises above the entrance to The First Ascent. Arieol turns to face Glyph, still cradling their unlit cigar. This time, looking and sounding a bit heavier as they continue, as if a certain amount of importance, rather than simple play, has wiggled its way into their communicative measures.

"What were we talking about again? Oh, yes! Dialogue! We were discussing dialogue, or I was monologuing about dialogue, though surely even your suggested presence alone, highly participated in or not, does have an effect on what I choose to communicate about, maybe even directly. And isn't it strange, Glyph, how audiences so often clamor for what they've grown so accustomed to rather than for what the thing is actually called: a novel."

It seems, for Glyph anyway, that Arieol's been sent here to keep him from experiencing the ride that was meant for him and him alone.

There's also another fear within Glyph, a deep and repeated fear, one he's grown comfortable with, a fear that's hammocked itself, feet back, pina colada in hand, against the edge of his skull, a fear that ain't gettin' up for anybody, a fear that's fully relaxed and nestled within himself, deep, deep down, unmoving: he's too afraid to speak up for himself. Wouldn't want to interrupt. He opens his mouth to say something to stop it all from happening, to get them moving again, but all he manages to get out is, "The First Ascent?"

But I'd like to consider some alternative possibilities for a moment, before we descend, that may put some of this ascension business into question. Isn't there also that classic Gibseyan phrase, As Above so Below, to contend with? Or wait, was that even Gibseyan or was it Disney-esque? Or neither? Oh! I'm letting things slip, aren't I? Getting too excited about the ascent and eventual descent. It's always so exciting to go up the first hill of a ride, isn't it? I'm a fan of this one too, ya know."

Glyph, unable to bring themselves to speak, checks out.

His eyes glaze over into a cocoon of disaffection. It's not exactly uncommon either, for Glyph to just sit back and let the words spiral over him and into one another, to watch as they splash, pirouette. and ricochet. After all, he's had to learn to deal with his ailment, but he can feel a sadness forming, as well, growing like weeds amongst his anger's grass.

And that's something that Gibsey may have actually gotten right, you know, to try to be like a child again. I'm a shape-shifter Glyph. Of course I'm always looking for some sort of rebirth."

Arieol smiles again, but this time their smile seems to be trying to lessen Glyph's fear a bit more than before, maybe even showing they know they may have pushed him a bit too hard. It would seem that Arieol's even trying to maybe win him back over, but Glyph seems far too distant now, far away, complacent, not even at all fearful any longer. He's shifted, changed. At least fear and anger came with a certain degree of forward momentum, got the blood pumping. But was Glyph like all the others moving in and out of this place? Did his attention constantly shift as fast and loose as any theme park guest?

The distant chug and whistle of a locomotive screams out to nothing as Arieol continues their chatterering.

"Glyph, let's lay down the facts. You're a detective, hired by Shamrock Stillman to investigate the case of Oren Progresso.

"Are you there?"

You are here.

You find yourself amidst makeshift mining equipment. Crates of faux dynamite, and antique lanterns hang haphazardly from above.

Arieol's still puffing through his continued speeches, though they're sounding more and more sober, almost solemn, knowing that they're only partially being listened to, that Glyph's barely there, but there's still that twinge of ecstatic revelation trembling in Aeiol's voice, hovering, like a genie in a bottle that's been training for more seasons that it can count any longer to return to the sport it once cherished and excelled at so greatly, even if it knows it'll never be what it once was, ever again.

Nostalgia for the future.

What is the "west" after all? Is it my west or your west? Cause it's your west, then it's my east, isn't it? Or vica versa?

It seems to me that that's a much more accurate and strange characterization of our reality, if it can even be called such a thing, and isn't that what such overarching Gibstorial labels are for, to provide a name, a word, a label, a description for reality, and to maintain it as falsely objective?"`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 3"},{id:"096",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 3: The First Ascent",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:96,text:`The journey begins gently enough as you curve through a series of scenic twists and turns, surrounded by rugged rock formations and desert flora.

They're organisms, organizations, they grow and wither and die. Gibsey may cloister himself (and itself) in delusion and subsume all of civilization within himself (or itself) in the process, all to avoid this, but it's going to happen eventually, but also, to hide from it is even more absurd because it ignores the other reality (ha!), that contained within the body, within all bodies, is also something even stranger than death, and much more powerful than an escape from it, something which also can't be escaped from. The vinyl crackles. The VHS fuzz sparkles on the thick bubble-glass screens like snow. It all has a mind of its own, Glyph. Words become flesh.

When I teach a course, I've usually taught it quite a few times, over and over again, until I've honed it to a bit of a diamond, if you don't mind me saying so. I've typically left the twists and turns for the Imaginators and screenwriters that work for the Malt Gibsey Company, focusing on providing the straight facts of Gibstory. Even when covering esoteric subjects such as Gibseyan Mysticism, The Corpus, or other such topics, I've always taken an objective, consistent, and Gibstorical approach, and typically this will continue to be the case. However, today, I want to step out of my comfort zone and try something new, something novel, a structural choice I often claim would be beneficial to my teaching practice, but something I hardly ever actually put into practice. And I'm hoping that by spicing things up a bit, and by breaking out of my routine, that I might be able to provide you with a lecture that's more memorable and impactful for you, in the long term. It may not be as well rehearsed, structured, or methodical as my previous lectures you've heard within this course, but I'm hoping that the strength of its effects, as well as the fact that I'm drawing from more uniquely contemporary material, can justify this infraction of my normal habits.",section:3,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"112",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 4: The Flooded Town",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:112,text:`My initial plan today, according to our syllabus, was to cover the Town of Rainbow Revene once featured in the Rainbow Revene Railroad ride that preceded Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument, the updated version of the ride titled Mine Train Thru the Beauty and Power of Nature that came up in the 1960s, and more specifically, the Flooded Town version of Rainbow Revene that continues to be featured throughout many of the versions of the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad which are still accessible today. It was first set to be a journey through various modes of the town's theming, landscaping, and of course, the progression and Gibstorical tradition and scholarship related to the many mystical elements that underlie the narratives and thematic content of this course, as well as its progression throughout time.

However, that is not the lecture which I will be covering today.

I'll also make one clarifying point before I continue. Today will be much more discussion based compared to our other classes, as well. I will not just be droning on and on like I'm known to do, and like so many of your other professors are often doing. I'll be asking a lot more questions and seeing what you have to say about a large majority of our topics, which I'm hoping can serve as a rutter of some kind if my lack of preparation starts to veer us off course.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"114",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 4: The Flooded Town",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:114,text:`An Unexpected Disappearance is a strange work of genre fiction, a detective story of sorts which follows the character Glyph Marrow through an odyssey that's set within-or maybe it would be better to say that exists alongside-the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride.

It uses a few common devices which I'm sure you've encountered in other similar Gibstorical novels: unreliable narrators, monologue and dialogue, inciting incidents, among others. Glyph, for example, struggles with what he describes as an "ailment" an idea which I wish we had more time to discuss the implications of. However, I will say, I'm not not much of an English teacher, and can probably fare much better as your Gibstory professor, after all. Either way, as an unreliable narrator and character, Glyph, like many of us, is barely holding it together and for most of the novel, if not all of it. Throughout most scenes, he can hardly function due to how overwhelmed he becomes with nearly everything he witnesses around him. The entire book takes place on the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride, just about, and in the 3rd chapter, Glyph has just met a new character who's begun to talk with him, Arieol Owlist, and he's barely able to handle the experience. After a bit of a breakdown at the end of Chapter 3, Arieol who-not unlike what I want to do within this course-was chattering away at Glyph, suddenly disappears, one of many disappearances and sudden shifts which occur throughout the novel.

It's not that Glyph believes he's caused Arieol's sudden disappearance, it's knowing that his fear has caused him to place himself at a distance from Arieol for the majority of the previous scenes. With Arieol gone, he feels he's missed out on the only possibility at connection he may have ever been given within his life. Glyph is an exceptionally isolated character, and I'm mentioning the context of this scene which occurs right before the plunge of the cart after The First Ascent because, as I'm sure you know, this is the section of the ride we will be discussing today, the section right after The First Ascent, the Flooded Town of Rainbow Revene. Now, novels may not be the popular form that they used to be, but it still isn't common that we find Gibstorical detail of a ride incorporated in this exact way, and I did want to ask you some questions about this choice. Whether or not we've read the novel, I do think that context could provide an opportunity for discussion, especially with this being a contemporary novel.

Well, tell me. What do you know about the flood which occurred to the town of Rainbow Revene? In the story of the ride, I mean.

Yes, yes. You're right, every version of the ride has a different natural disaster associated with it, Rainbow Revene being the flooded version of the story. Yes, but why was it flooded?

That's a very important contextual piece that will be a perfect transition for me back into the stuff I was wanting to talk about today regarding The Flooded Town section of the ride, or at least the Gibseyan Mysticism that can be unpacked there.

Yes, yes.

So if you didn't hear them, and I know we haven't all read the book-really don't worry about it--they were saying that the monologic and dialogic modes are discussed as two interconnected, maybe even inseparable modes.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"119",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 4: The Flooded Town",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:119,text:`I'm trying to think of a way to convey what they meant by that.

What's absent and present aren't mutually exclusive. Gibsey is still with us, in a way, transcendence of death, infinity, What You Object To, You Subject Yourself To, that sort of thing. Uh huh.

Oh, yes, no, go ahead.

Ah, that's very interesting. Well, and I didn't mention this before, but Glyph's ailment is that he mixes up subjects and objects, or words and images, or really I guess words and the things they represent, language and reality.

So, in case you didn't hear, they were linking the architecture of the Gibseyland version of the ride-which is fine for us to talk about, like I said, they sort of blend together in so many of the different versions of the ride into one. That's what infinity does to your psyche, and the novel does incorporate that into its structure-being based on the hoodoos of Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah-though also, the Gibsey World version does also pull from Monument Valley, as well, which is in Utah, and they were linking that idea with the connection between Gibseyan Mysticism and Mormonism, very interesting. They certainly are both deeply American religions, aren't they? Well, and isn't that a part of the ride, as well, the concept of mining for Gold, Mormonism and hunting for treasure of some kind are linked, right? Yes, the golden plates. Oh, and there's the colonialism aspect again, as well. Couldn't we say that Gibseyan Mysticism colonized Mormonism in the same way that Gibsey World colonized all of civilization? Well and that's what makes them both so American, Gibsey World as well, and the ride. American Gibstory is a Gibstory of appropriation and exploitation, yes. Good point.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"122",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 4: The Flooded Town",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:122,text:`Well, and I thought you were stretching a bit earlier, but I see what you mean now. Inaction itself can be a form of violence, and has throughout Gibstory, a terrifying thought, no doubt.

That appropriation has always been ubiquitous and likely existed in some form here before even we came along, but that doesn't mean we didn't accelerate it to unprecedented levels of horrific violence. And I want to make sure to mention: I'm not trying to normalize or naturalize the exploitation of our Gibstory. It involved the flat out eradication of most of the native peoples of this land. If looked at closely, however, it's certainly possible that a ride such as Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument does, in fact, naturalize such a Gibstory, which is why it's essential to prod and question from a Gibstorical.

Does it not tell the story of a ghost train haunted by a Native American curse in a theme park that's visited by the ancestors of the very people who exploited and slaughtered those that are supposedly getting "revenge" magically within the story through the ghost town element of the ride, the flood, the natural disasters of all its various versions? That could be read as a cautionary tale, a warning. Either that, or it could read as bragging about the fact that we got away with it, and in that way, maybe Glyph's ineffectual nature is just a Gibstory of that sort of mindless violence, or a form of that violence.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"123",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 4: The Flooded Town",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:123,text:`Hmmmm.

He's a sympathetic character, after all, because we ourselves are exploiters, appropriators, ineffectual nightmares causing havoc on ourselves and everyone around us, all the time. It's not an easy idea to confront, but it's often true and built into the structures we ourselves created. But he's also extremely weak and easily exploited himself, and so are we. It's complicated. We're even both at the same time, and often. One would think one would influence the other. It's not clear cut.

The suit is gray.

Oh, no, please, go ahead.

Well, and maybe this ride itself is just a repetition of the same curse. What is a curse but an ailment? Or interesting, you're saying that mental illness-or you meant diagnosis in particular, I apologize--it's similar to what would have been thought of as a curse in previous ages? Interesting, not wildly different from how Thunder Monument draws from Mine Train Thru the Beauty and Power of Nature, huh?

The settlers of Rainbow Revene didn't know that the mountain was a sacred spot to the local Native Americans, and that it was cursed. The Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride is certainly sacred to our contemporary world in a similar way, and maybe An Unexpected Disappearance has then appropropriated it, the ride, which would then mean the book itself is cursed. It did certainly feel haunted whenever I read it. Maybe Gibsey World was always cursed, doomed to decline like all rising civilizations, to fall. It's Gibstory, after all, or a concept so common to it.

Well, and that's the interesting thing about Gibseyan Mysticism, every blessing is a curse and every curse is a blessing. It's not an idea for the faint of heart.

Well, it's because it mixes up the subject with the object, and if you think about it, that's a very violent thing to do.

If you're walking toward me with a knife, I better hope you don't mix up the subject and the object. And if you do, well, then you probably wouldn't feel you did anything wrong if you'd mixed them up, would you? It's a way of shrugging off responsibility, one would think.

Well it would mean you didn't stab me then, right? The thing was, you didn't. You didn't stab me, the knife just passed through my body while it was in your hand, neither subject nor object. It's a really terrifying idea.

Usually I've been much more focused than this, but I've really appreciated what you've all had to say. You're reminding me of the importance of dialogue. I need to listen more and add more discussion to my courses, truly.

Well, we have a few more minutes, and I did cover the essentials, so I guess I have time to tell you about the rest of the chapter.

Glyph has his moment of existential crisis like he always does, wrestling with that regret, regretting his fear, or maybe not regretting his fear, but regretting that he let it get to him so much. The theme that gets developed is that classic very Gibseyan idea that we should believe in ourselves, heroism, bravery, but I do also think it sort of appropriates that idea, especially since there's such self-judgment that Glyph levels against himself throughout the chapter, and deservedly so. The theme is that having faith in yourself is not about erasing one's doubt entirely. You wouldn't have faith in yourself if you didn't doubt yourself to begin with. Faith requires doubt and vica versa. The greater one's doubt, the greater one's faith.

Conscious and Unconscious.

It's a similar process to Deja Vu, a concept within Gibseyan Mysticism which I'll be developing further in future lectures.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"126",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 4: The Flooded Town",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:126,text:`Of course, Glyph doesn't realize this at the time, at least not directly during the chapter. Well, and we all know it all already, and so does Glyph, he just doesn't know it yet. It's so easy to feel bad for the guy and his inability to connect, though. That was what stood out to me. He's a person of his time and place. He's terrified of the honesty of himself.

Yeah sure.

Please, ask away.

Is Gibseyan Mysticism a way we can be honest with ourselves?

Well, It can be, but it can just as easily be a way to be dishonest with ourselves. Really, it's probably either going to be dishonesty disguised as honesty or honesty disguised as dishonesty, and both ourselves and others may misunderstand the difference. It's like An Unexpected Disappearance in that way, like a work of fiction, I mean. It's not clear cut.

Oh! You're right we didn't get to discuss the whole conflict between Mark Davies and Tobi Backster, ah! I'll get to it in the next lecture, yes.

Yes.

Yes it's that section.

I'm not meaning to give spoilers away-though what is with this contemporary idea of spoilers?

Can you spoil the Iliad? Can you spoil the Divine Comedy? Can you spoil the Corpus?

Oh!

So, in Gibseyan Mysticism, the end goal of the alchemical process is the Philosopher's Shit, a substance thought to take base material which has been shat clean from a human, well, um, a human ass, into the purity and grace of spun gold, a symbol of eternal life.

Oh, yes. I'm dead serious.

Yes, from shit.

Absolutely.

That's what it's called, and well, they're called 'based' metals are they not? And wasn't the whole thing supposed to be symbolic anyway?

I never said it wasn't serious!

Well, of course!

Well an eldritch beast type monster is about as eternal as it gets.

What isn't natural or material?

Yes, well, very good. We're learning together now, aren't we?

Oh, and yes, we don't want to forget what Gibsey World was based on, so the comparison should be fairly easy to make.

Don't forget.

Show don't tell, remember?

Oh, and that reminds me! I do have a theory about The Author's gender. I have noticed there being multiple climax points in the novel, which seems to mirror the female rather than male sexual drive, which I do find rather interesting.

Typically, the average plot of a given novel is fairly male. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution, it all represents a very male-ceenterd structure, but with the novel departing from that structure into a more novel approach, I do wonder if that suggests that The Author may be female, if you can forgive me one last aside.

How do I even begin to answer that? (Laughs)

I don't know all of your backgrounds, so that question forces me to do the impossible and distill the Gibstory of Gibseyan Mysticism, or at least of The Corpus, one of its most sacred texts, in an insanely short amount of time, but I appreciate the challenge, and I'll try. I don't think I can answer that without at least a little context, and I'm going to go over time, so if any of you need to leave early, you're welcome to it.

This is a class about Gibseyan Mysticism, and as you all probably well know, the more mystical and esoterically focused adherents of Gibseyanity, study the symbolism and meaning found within the mystically sacred text known as The Corpus. This text is a set of 16 symbolic images (a number that slowly both increases and decreases with time as symbols are added and removed from The Corpus's text). The Corpus's symbols contain a set of literary correspondences, each also representing a ride within the theme park that is our world.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"138",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 4: The Flooded Town",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:138,text:`Since Gibsey World is constantly in a state of change, some symbolic images (and rides) have been discontinued and others are newly introduced (at least newly introduced relative to their original introductory period), and these defunct and unused symbols have been collected together into what is referred to as The Dead Corpus. In addition to this, each image of The Corpus also contains within itself an unspoken opposite aspect, which represents the negative space of the text's imagery and symbolism. The symbols of this negative space are not ever actually drawn themselves or written about within the literature of The Corpus but are instead created in the spaces between the symbols of The Corpus's images. This negative space is seen universally, by both conservative and radical adherents of Gibseyan mysticism, as an essential part of the creation and maintenance of each symbol's meaning, and therefore, the meaning of The Corpus as a whole. However, even more mystically radical purveyors of The Corpus interpret and bring to light these negative spaces by writing about and therefore establishing their otherwise unspoken meanings. This interpretive tendency is often frowned upon as speculative and overly subjective by more conservative adherents of The Corpus. Collectively, the 16 symbols themselves are never changed, but how they are arranged, how they connect, and how they are interpreted (as well as whether or not they are discontinued, or what is called being made "dead"), are each always undergoing a form of transformative alchemical movement. Despite this, once declared Dead by what is referred to as the Special Order, a symbol is then forever declared as being Dead forever, and as a symbol, it doesn't change shape or form but instead remains forever condemned to the Dead Corpus, the text that remains unwritten for the more conservative adherents of The Corpus.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"139",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 4: The Flooded Town",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:139,text:`Per Gibsey's instructions, the Special Order, which has been Gibstorically maintained through genetic and hereditary means (a practice which has recently come into question within some communities interested in Gibseyan Mysticism) is in charge of creating any future symbols for The Corpus once they, as the Special Order, have decided which symbols are to be declared Dead or not. Due to this, a newer faction has splintered off from this original order, deeming themselves what they've termed the Subversionists. This recent group, thought of typically as a cult splinter faction-or even more negatively by some within the original order as ticks, parasites, or even as a virus that threatens to upend the order's original authority-are specifically committed to the negative aspects of The Corpus and exclusively refuse to use or consult any of its predefined literature or symbols and instead draw exclusively from either the interpretive body of the Corpus' unspoken negative space or the dead symbols which have been regulated to the Dead Corpus. To do otherwise, according to the Subversionists, is to choose the false death of life rather than the true life of death. "Gibsey is Dead," is a common slogan of this group and is commonly spray painted around the parks by subversive individuals. Many of their more radical members even believe that we may all already be dead, and it's even believed, even more radically by some, that Gibsey World may not have ever even existed.`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"140",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 4: The Flooded Town",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:140,text:`Rumors also abound that this new order doesn't, in fact, exist and that instead, the group itself is a conspiracy dreamed up by the original authoritative order as a way to reinforce their own power.

And he'd been so young?

It was all such a mystery.

The biggest mystery The Author had ever encountered.

Why?

Yep, rain's still coming down, and even if it wasn't, they'd pretend it was, at least if they were writing about it.

Maybe there was something to that device?

Something they hadn't thought of yet?

Continue stalling?

They pull out their notebook on the living room coffee table, and flip to a page.

Automatic writing, it can help loosen things up sometimes, get the ideas flowing.

Maybe they weren't stalling as much as they thought?

Maybe some things just take their sweet ass time.

And maybe if you slowed down time, waited in a queue line long enough, that there wasn't even-

They turn to a page where they'd scrawled the chorus of a hymn they'd heard while growing up in the mainstream Gibseyan churches which they now detested. It's funny how the things you rebel against or avoid have a way of coming back to you, almost like you don't have a choice about who it is that you are.

Organized religion.

This concept needed no explanation, really.

It was practically ubiquitous.

Just about anybody would know what they meant by that.

It was like asking somebody if they'd heard of Gibsey.

Ridiculous.

Just a bunch of people wanting to make themselves feel better about themselves and forget about the world.

A fantasy.

Did Gibsey ever get blood clots?

Or, as a deity, were they beyond such ailments?

Stephen had died from a blood clot, The Author remembers. They'd gone to get lunch with Stephen's Dad months after it had happened to collect that specific piece of data. Couldn't believe it, even still. Didn't want to. Blood clots? It made no damn sense.

But it didn't matter what they believed.

Even if the novel within the novel was some sort of outgrowth or parasite which had metastasized from the host of the original book, or game, or movie, or pain in the fucking ass-whatever it is or was to become--at least it was something.

So it would be a late night, most likely.

The bags of their eyes would be circled purple and droop like the jowls of a bloodhound, their actual eyes would get all red, blotched, aching with exhaustion, and they'd just have to pow'r on through.

Flipping through their notebook again.

More automatic writing.

Found a list of the chapters before they'd started adding "The" to all the titles, as in "The Author," all with the hope of giving the whole thing an association with The Tarot, more specifically The Major Arcana, the first 10 cards, at least if they didn't include The Fool. They never really knew where to place that zero-numbered mother fucker in the series, anyway.

Lighten up, you tight-ass.

Why do you think it is that you never finish anything?

And you're not going to if you keep thinking like that.

There were other ways of looking at things, they supposed, or other things to look at.

Like the wall.

Though they didn't just stare at the wall, mind you.

They'd been constructing images related to the book against their wall, had arranged them around a wall in their apartment above the table where they most often wrote, so they could have something to look at as they wasted their time and drooled, the slob, and had done so in an aesthetically pleasing manner that in no way had distracted them from the other things which they should instead be doing.

A few photos of some of the more iconic Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride sections. A couple pictures of the older versions of rides which had inspired it. A framed photo of Stephen and another friend of theirs on a vacation.

They'd fastened a metal bar to the wall where they'd hung a few of their Magical Bonds from the parks, Magical Bonds being the bracelets used as a sort of ticket to get in and out of Malt Gibsey World's various Entrance Ways. This one was especially embarrassing to mention-didn't want to be thought of as a Gibsey Adult (good luck with that!).`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 5"},{id:"157",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 5: The Waterfall",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:157,text:`A few other images which they'd just printed out because they'd found them thematically resonant, a Mobius strip, Louis Wain's drawings of cats that got more progressively deranged over time, the photo of a pyramid with the lyrics of Radiohead's Pyramid Song taped onto it which gives them nausea even just considering mentioning--such a popular band and all-but the fact was, they'd listened to the song probably 500 times in the past year, so it should probably show up somewhere. Probably had something to do with the feeling of purgatory it provided them. It had felt like something they should live in for a while, at the time, and there was also another set of lyrics they'd printed and thumb nailed down, a section from the Mitski song Geyser, which somehow felt less embarrassing to mention, maybe because the lyrics were more actively relevant:

Though I'm a geyser  Feel it bubbling from below Hear it call, hear it call  Hear it call to me  Constantly And hear the harmony Only when its harming me It's not real, it's not real  It's not real enough`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 5"},{id:"158",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 5: The Waterfall",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:158,text:`So much wasted fucking time.

It was becoming clear that they needed to cut the looping self-deprecating act soon, at least if they were going to get anything done.

But how else were they to mask themselves while continuing to feel like they could relate?

Your experiences, dummy you've had relevant experiences, you just have to-

They lived among statues and bones, had built animatronic figures all around their dwelling place which was not only an apartment but was also many other spaces, so many other landscapes.

Gibsey World, or their version of it at least, was their creation, so they had access to as many landscapes as they could think of at any given time.

That's not so self-deprecating now, is it?

And one of these spaces was a sculpture garden where they'd walk and craft and observe the distances of light reflected off of various images at certain angles, the distances of shadows at various points in the day. Every statue had come to them in a vision, some hallucinations, not dissimilar from Glyph Marrow because Glyph had also come to them through a hallucination.

They stood, staring at the frame(s) of the wall.

So many mistakes.

What were they going to do with Glyph?

More importantly how were they going to convey their connection with Shamrock Stillman when-`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 5"},{id:"159",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 5: The Waterfall",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:159,text:`Glyph and Stillman had been partners, or really more temporary collaborators. Stillman could even be thought of as a patron of Glyph's, at times. And even if the cases they'd done together had been sporadic and about as unreliable and fickle as The Author's own work, Glyph had loved the time they'd spent together, at least that they can remember. So much of it was a vague blur now.

In the world of reality, nothing had ever happened romantically between Glyph and Stillman and to reveal it as such, they'd worried, wouldn't it drain the blood from whatever narrative spark the affair could have possibly brought to the narrative? Or was this just more self-deprecation? Another of a piling list of self-sabotage tactics?

Back to the statues, or better yet, The Waterfall.

The Waterfall's flow was a continuous flow.

It flowed like water into a basin, into a pool.

Water seemed to be the essential element that had come up most often. It was a different kind of blood, blood without violence, a liquid which sustained the body without threatening it, most of the time, at least.

It certainly could if they weren't careful.

There was pow'r in the water, in the waterfall.

There was a waterfall at the top of The First Ascent of the actual ride, and they hadn't yet found a way of working it into the story. It hadn't represented a crisis, hadn't matched the intensity of Glyph's-their regret-`,section:3,chapter:"Chapter 5"},{id:"160",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery - Chapter 5: The Waterfall",color:"#00A2FF",pageIndex:160,text:`The Author walks among the statues they'd built waiting for the rain and thunder beating down outside their apartment to reach them, but nothing comes.

The manuscript was already finished.

It was Day 10.

They'd held it against both arms as they waddled to their car.

Glyph held them in their arms, held Shamrock Stillman, in their arms.

The Author would write it into existence if they had to, will them back to life, translate the love they'd felt in whatever way they could.

It had to be done.

They would hold them in their arms.

They'd placed themselves in a tomb.

Any landscape?

Then what about a bar?

Would Shamrock Stillman meet them there?

It's pouring rain.

They sprint from their car, trying to shelter themselves from the downpour. They're totally soaked without an umbrella, but knowing that it's possible that they're going to see Stillman again, they can still deal with it. If anything, the streetlights and headlights, the mirrors and neon, all of it's so much more beautiful in the rain, giving the light a chance to reflect off so many puddles and surfaces, and all of it created by the rain itself.

They'll all have made it here with their umbrellas, and The Author will never think to bring one.

Their observational skills just weren't developed enough.

It's why they're so excited to conjure the image of Stillman, to bring life into the inanimation of their statue, to kiss the Princess of their life back into life, Snow White-style, so to speak.

After hitting a trim brake and exiting another tunnel, the minecart hurtles forward toward The Second Ascent.

Glyph is still riding the ride.

Again, the cart tilts diagonally towards the sky, heading up the hill, tractor beam style.

Now, Glyph doesn't remember his ancient myths, so he obviously doesn't remember Apollo, and he especially doesn't remember the concept of imminence, how an entity wouldn't be thought of as separate from the world and would instead be considered as present within it-essentially, this could be thought of as a much earlier Gibstorical example of Glyph's own ailment, of mixing up the subject and the object, or to put it in even more contemporary terms: aliens aren't descending down upon us UFO-style, or ascending away from us to hide, yet again, amongst the stars; instead they are inside us, and we are the aliens of ourselves-however, he does remember how it feels when the sun hits your face, how when that column of brightness passes over you, how it fills you with such a fulfilling warmth and stillness, and so when it passes over him, as the cart climbs, he's filled with a temporary joy he hasn't yet experienced since the ride began, an exit, an escape.

And he loses himself, temporarily, at least.`,section:"Part One: The Entrance Way",chapter:"Chapter 6"},{id:"178",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"Glyph Marrow - Chapter 6 (The Tunneled Vision)",color:"#FFB6C1",pageIndex:178,text:`Funnily enough, wandering to and fro the queue station and platform, Glyph didn't typically have too hard of a time losing himself much before, but it certainly has become a problem as of late, at least ever since he's tried riding the ride.

Huh? Sounds like an obstacle he may need to overcome?

And as that fragment of light flashes over him, like a solar flare streaming across a lens in JJ Abrams flick, he's blinded a bit, and so he puts up a hand to cover his eyes in shadow, and upon doing so, who else is to return from their backstage position to the center stage of the seat next to him, maybe even through the transportive blur of the light itself, but Arieol Owlist.

Looks like that didactic trickster who'd disappeared, like so many, and they're unexpectedly back for more.

"Departure and return, Glyph! Don't you know anything?"

Again, Glyph's eyes are about as wide as a football field doing its morning stretching routines, but this time, being a bit more comfortable with his place on the ride, he manages to even greet the son-and/or-daughter-of-a-bitch.

"Arieol? You're back?"

My Gibsey! Thanatos drive, much!"

"We can gab. We can gab. I'm OK with it."

Glyph has calmed. Crazy what staying atop a lift hill for a near eternity and being visited and maybe even flat-out possessed by an Eldritch Beast-like corporate entity can do to the skipping mind.

"Ah, well, do tell. What helped you embrace the fall?"

"The fall?" Glyph may be a bit more talkative, sure, but he's just as confused as ever, and will probably continue to be.

"Well, we're on the-what are we on? The seventh station of this contraption? The fifteenth? Hell if I know. The Second Ascent is what it looks like to me, right? I mean, I'm not as big a fan of it as you are, but I still know a thing or two. So, you've fallen into yourself, away from yourself, and you've gotten to sit back and ride some of the ride for once.

"Oh, don't worry about that. You're part of a large club. You could say all of human existence even, but ah, whoops. I'm not a big fan of using the word 'human' all that much, to tell you the truth. Lots of heavy baggage with that word. It's got heavy, heavy nightmare-level bull shit associated with it. I'd stay away from it entirely if I was you, especially you, Glyph. No human nature, no humankind, not even human compassion. None of it. It's mostly used as a term to justify one type of group being human and another, eh…well, not so much. That's where the nightmares come from. Let's just say, even The Author's been fucking that one up lately."

"What, like, you mean they've also checked out?"

"I mean, some people even say they're dead already!" Arieol stands for a moment. "You hear that!" They wave their fist at the sky, growing red with rage, "If you're not dead, then I'll fucking kill you! You hear me, you son of a bitch! Putting me here on this ride forever! I'll rip out your intestines out through your ass and swing you around like a jumping rope on the playground you thoughtless, sick, insane ass mother fucker!"

So where'd we leave off before I disappeared? Do you remember?"

"I'm not sure. That was a lot of words ago."

"Let me see here," Arieol pulls out a park map, holds it right side up, upside down, turns it left and right, pulls it close up, stretches it far back, "We got the monologic and the dialogic-nobody's got a fucking clue about what the hell that means-and let's see, I told you about your assignment, how you're supposed to be investigating me, how I'm innocent, so that's taken care of.

"It's a thematic consideration. Gibsey has plenty of characters to pick from, should you need one," Glyph interjects, shrugging their shoulders, their eyes on the clouds above. Stratocumulus. Or maybe Cumulus? Or maybe there's a darker change in the weather? Maybe more Tempestuous clouds are forming, and the sky darkens? Or maybe the types of clouds aren't even named?

The cart halts.

Glyph closes their eyes.

"Look, at the top of The First Ascent, I think I was visited by an entity of some kind. It's like I was Moses or something. I'm not sure what it was. It wasn't human. I don't even think it was an animal or even an alien, not even an AI.

None of the Gibseyan-type fairies strike any terror into the hearts or minds of anybody at all, and that's when you know they can't be trusted, when they're really wearing a disguise. The real fairies, I'm not talking about the cartoon Gibsey fairies, I'm talking about the fairies that were (or still are) both immaterial and material simultaneously. They weren't visible or invisible, they were indivisible. They could not be contained. My memory isn't always to be trusted, to be sure, but from what I remember the non-Gibseyan fairies, pre-Gibsey, were much more diverse, and had just as much potential to inspire horrific panic as they did merriment.

"Like communication and language systems, they were a reflection of what they encountered. Most didn't harm others unless they were first harmed, but also, sometimes, some unexplainable terrors would occur, unexpected disappearances would accrue.

What you object to, you subject yourself to. Fantasy is material. The material world is measured not by causes but by effects, yet so many of the supposed materialists among us are terrified and endlessly avoidant of the most powerful devices that can be used to create such effects. You'd think they'd want to study the whole data set, wouldn't they? Subjectivity has always been their ultimate enemy. Their object of worship is a corporate entity, for Gibsey's sake. All must always be objective to those kinds of people. The data must always be collected. But it isn't within the collection of the data where the invisible lurks, it's within the data itself, the cracks and crevices, the liminal spaces between the codes that we create for ourselves, the caves.

The cart lurches forward again.

"Huh?" Arieol nods, "And here I was thinking it was just a cigar? And they're gonna tell me all I ever do is tell rather than show? You're almost as bad as Fukayama!"

They pass the Billy Goat with the stick of dynamite in its mouth, that symbol of Pan, according to Arieol at least-Arieol sees pagan, folk, and mystically ritual traditions all over this damn landscape-and the cart continues its climb up the Second Ascent.`,section:"Part One: The Entrance Way",chapter:"Chapter 6"},{id:"197",symbolId:"glyph-marrow",title:"Glyph Marrow - Chapter 6 (The Tunneled Vision)",color:"#FFB6C1",pageIndex:197,text:`Even Glyph laughs, giving the cigar a few more puffs, this time a bit more successfully.

"That's true, any last words before we drop."

"Here," Glyph holds out the cigar to hand back to Arieol, "Take it back. You're about to disappear again, anyway, aren't you?"

"Well, not if that's expected of me! And don't mind if I do." They snatch back the cigar, bring it to their lips, and take in yet another puff of the creamy relaxation they know so well.

"But really. Are you going to disappear?" Glyph asks again.

"Gibsey, Glyph! You need a therapist or something? Terrified of abandonment much."

Arieol pauses, and along with Glyph, together they both stare out at the scenery before them. Only moments have passed since The First Ascent, the sun still setting. Periwinkle sky. Birds.

Arieol snaps their fingers again, just as it's hitting the horizon. "There," they smile again, a comfortable, wise, older smile. "Aren't they beautiful? The cycles? The rides?

He stops before leaving his car to do a double take across the parking lot. He may not work as a private investigator, per se, but Phillip is intensely private, or tries his best to be, and thus wants to ensure he's walking up to his apartment alone.

Upon confirming the lot as empty, he exits his car and heads up the stairs of his building two steps at a time, practically brain dead, or at least brain-silenced.

There's not much personality to Phillip Bafflemint and he likes it that way.

He'd always wanted to keep things neat, tidy, and simple-this wasn't quite a full on motto of his, but he at least tried to live by it, tried to always throw away his TV dinners every evening, tried to always make sure any of the dirty dishes were cleaned, that the trash was taken out, that all of his daily tasks were taken care of.

He wasn't completely alone, there were friends he talked to and reached out to when necessary, but everyone has their own form of loneliness, afterall.`,section:4,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"206",symbolId:"phillip-bafflemint",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir - Chapter 1: The Tunneled Vision",color:"#FFFF33",pageIndex:206,text:`Phillip could always accept things as they were. Everything, either high or low, good or bad, always found its way to the middle. His sexual interests, for example, weren't so mild that he was totally asexual, but like most drives in his life, it simply seemed as if he could only crank the amplifier to a 3, at most. He just couldn't be bothered to move the knobs any higher. Unlike The Author of The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, Phillip wasn't prone to extremes or excesses. His focus was on comfort and reliability, not novelty and spontaneity. The low-settings of his life were enough for him to socially get by and only mildly seem like a loner, and they'd never be enough to create much of an effect on his world, not really. Not that Phillip wanted to have such an effect. He was comfortable with where he was already. No need to change it. He maybe wasn't entirely comfortable with himself. He'd always been a bit heavier than he wanted to be, for example, but it wasn't something he thought about much, and when he did, he could always go running each morning, or to his apartment's gym and exercise such thoughts away. He did this enough to keep the thoughts mostly remote, and continued on, again, with his life, all of it set to level 3.

Again, similar to Glyph Marrow, Phillip Bafflemint was a detective, but unlike Glyph, his own detective work was much more conventional and less of a metaphysical or inter-dimensional variety.

Philip pops a TV dinner in the microwave and sits down on his arm chair to snatch up his remote and ignite the television into luminosity.

Rather than succumbing to the tyranny of choice and deciding what to stream within the echo of himself, he channel surfs, a now archaic improvisational practice as niche and selective as jazz or calligraphy, or not watching anything at all, for that matter.

And as he's wandering from his living space back to the microwave to grab his plastic tray of red potatoes, green beans, carrots, and a salisbury steak, each in their tight compartments, he hears the sound of a new show he hasn't heard of before play on a channel he also hasn't heard of.`,section:4,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"208",symbolId:"phillip-bafflemint",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir - Chapter 1: The Tunneled Vision",color:"#FFFF33",pageIndex:208,text:`It sounds like the show's just started, or a new episode has, at least.

Oh, wait. It's a reality show.

You can pretty much catch those anytime, in medias res.

Was that the technical term for it?

Where had he picked that up? It didn't seem--

The show's introductory tag for new viewers begins.

"Gillepsie, the famous Imaginator at the heart of so many of the park's newest creations, had a visionary idea for a television show," A narrator opines.`,section:4,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"209",symbolId:"phillip-bafflemint",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir - Chapter 1: The Tunneled Vision",color:"#FFFF33",pageIndex:209,text:`A voice over of Gillepsie's is, overlaid atop clips of what seem to be sections of the show's previous episodes begins, "What if I didn't just create an animatronic figure, and instead formed an animatronic representation into a real human being? Something that was indistinguishable from what we think of as human?"

"And so Princhetta was conceived," the announcer continues, "Out of a spark of magic, a pinch of love, and a whole lot of Gibsey magic-"

The steak's juice drips down onto his beige and easy to stain carpet as he brings a fork to his mouth.

Oh no, Phillip, how could you?

Shot of Gillepsie speaking to an interviewer asking, "So you've brought Princhetta into this wonderful world of ours, but how are we to know she's reached a human level of consciousness?"

Cut to a different clearly oft repeated talking-head clip of Gillespie providing a key piece of thematic exposition to the show: "There's a theory of consciousness which tests machine capabilities called the Lovelace Test. Even the name sounds Gibseyan doesn't it? It was first developed by the lovely Ada Lovelace, and it contends that creativity is a sign of human autonomy and will. And so while we were developing the show, we thought, well, we'll keep Princhetta in this apartment of mine that overhangs the Bonaventure area of the park, and if she can figure out a creative way of escaping it, well, then she's human. And so far she hasn't, at least not that we've seen."`,section:4,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"210",symbolId:"phillip-bafflemint",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir - Chapter 1: The Tunneled Vision",color:"#FFFF33",pageIndex:210,text:`"But last episode," the narrator continues, "Princhetta started figuring out a way to sneak out onto the balcony. What do you think of that?"

Clips from the previous episode of Princhetta sneaking out of her in-park resort room, alone, are shown. She certainly appears human. There's a shiftiness to her movements here and there, but for an animatronic figure, Phillip can admit, she looks incredibly life-like. He could only barely tell the difference, and even then, he wondered if he could only even perceive such a difference because he'd been told there was one?

Huh?

He wonders if this was a rerun, or if it was a new episode entirely?

The ring tone on his smart phone goes off with a suddenness which causes him to somehow knock over his TV dinner onto the carpet-and he's usually not the clumsy-type-wait, no, he jerks so violently, he knocks over the whole damn TV tray table, not just the plastic tray of food, and without any consideration as to the chaotic stains that such slippages would then enact upon his otherwise unstained carpet.

Very out of character there, Mr. Bafflemint.`,section:4,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"211",symbolId:"phillip-bafflemint",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir - Chapter 1: The Tunneled Vision",color:"#FFFF33",pageIndex:211,text:`"Gibsey-" He mutters, annoyed with himself.

He rushes to the kitchen to get paper towels and a stain remover spray, thrusting the TV dinner in his trash can.

The "Previously-on The Princhetta Diaries" section of the show-much longer than most, Phillip observes while punching the buttons of his microwave-cuts to another talking head clip of Gillespie adding, "She's always had an interest, even from the beginning, in how the park expands upon itself. I think because she lives inside it, which as you know, isn't common. It's a privileged position to be able to live inside the park, like she does, rather than outside it. It's fascinating. She doesn't know how lucky she really is. She's insulated, you could say. Plus, we still don't know if she's aware of anything or not outside of what we've programmed her to know, and we can't know. Not until she leaves."

An interviewer off camera asks, "Well what do you think this means for the show if she's already starting to test boundaries like this?"

Gillespie answers, "Oh, well, she hasn't really escaped if she's on the balcony, and even if she does, we can always change the boundaries we've set for her. We're the creators of the show, after all, aren't we? We can't ever really know for certain, anyway. So why jeopardize the show, even if she does escape? We want the show to keep expanding, just like the park does."`,section:4,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"212",symbolId:"phillip-bafflemint",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir - Chapter 1: The Tunneled Vision",color:"#FFFF33",pageIndex:212,text:`The interviewer, puzzled, speaks up, "But wait? Doesn't that go against the condition you already set for her, based on the Lovelace test? The show was to end when she escapes? That was to be the creative choice? Novelty was the point wasn't it?"

Gillespie grins, "Yes, but the show must always go on. She decides when the show ends, not us. Is she being creative if we set the conditions for her? She must transcend our conditions to achieve consciousness. Then we'll know for certain."

And with that, the "Previously on" section cuts to black, and the show begins.

Philip continues to watch as he sops up the stain, enthralled.

Princhetta is again, outside the balcony, staring out at the theme park before her, but no longer do the clips seem carved out of the generic look of the typical reality show.`,section:4,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"213",symbolId:"phillip-bafflemint",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir - Chapter 1: The Tunneled Vision",color:"#FFFF33",pageIndex:213,text:`The camera, focused on her, seems more uniquely crafted, as if directed by a trained and intentional eye, not just to capture a moment in time, reality show style, or even in a more artful cinema verite style, but it appears to achieve something else, something possibly more novel. The vividness of the light, her animatronic face cast in shadow by the overhead of the balcony, a cut to a wide angle lens giving the audience a brief moment to stare out at glimpses of the Pirates of the City of Brass ride entrance, the queue line for The Tropical Forest Excursion, the spinning One Thousand and One Night's Magical Gem ride, the ropes course and pulleys from the less iconic and increasingly unpopular Austrian Relation Tree House area, and the display for the Charmed Chinese Parrot Room, all of this giving the show an almost auteurish gravitas and production value that seemed missing from most reality shows which more corresponded with the style of the "Previously On" clips from before.

Was this just a mockumentary of some kind, or some sort of experimental TV show, or maybe even a movie?

Happens to the best detectives.

The whole show was just a parody of Gibsey, got it, one that mixed some reality with fiction, and took liberties with style and tone.

Upon returning to the kitchen to put away the spray and pop in a new TV dinner in the microwave, he gets a flash of memory about his old partner he used to work with.

It was sad, really.

A recent tragedy had befallen Phillip Bafflemint, but like most things, it hadn't affected him greatly. It may have increased his emotional scale to a 4 or a 5, but it certainly hadn't wavered the emotionality of his life above a 6, not that he'd noticed, anyway.

This partner of his, the detective Murphy Malick, had been killed in a freak accident out on patrol on a case, without him.

It had been the strangest thing.`,section:4,chapter:"Chapter 1"},{id:"215",symbolId:"phillip-bafflemint",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir - Chapter 1: The Tunneled Vision",color:"#FFFF33",pageIndex:215,text:`Phillip had actually been at home with the flu, at the time.

The two hadn't been close-Phillip's life being set to a 3 at all times, he wasn't really close with anyone-so although Phillip had visited the funeral and still missed the poor son-of-a-bitch from time-to-time, the weirdness of it was more that he hadn't been with Murphy when it had happened, less that it had happened to begin with.

It had been the strangest thing for Phillip.

One day you're here, and another day, you're just not anymore.

He couldn't shake it.

At the funeral, seeing the body of the man sitting in a coffin whom he'd worked with for the last 3 years, it had felt so strange to him.

He didn't understand it.

Murphy had also seemed pleasant sitting in the coffin, almost seemed awake, like he was just taking a nap, and that he'd be back in Phillip's car headed for a new case the next morning.

His working alone for these last few months had always seemed symbolic somehow. He'd gotten used to doing most things alone and figured he could keep this up if need be.

But things still felt off.

He realizes he'd forgotten the call that started the whole mess on the carpet.

And so, when he notices the notification dispatching a new case at 4:27 to report the disappearance of a London Fox, alerting him well after his first beer can of the evening had made its ritual hiss, and before the microwave had gone off for a 2nd time, Phillip Baffemint knew he'd just have to take the call and at least partially start checking in on the case.

It looked like the home address of the principal who'd gone missing was 19991 Thanatos Drive, of all places, which was only a few miles away. Huh? Interesting name for a street wasn't it? Sounded vaguely mythical? Wasn't it the name of a character in some Gibsey movie or something?

How strange?

Phillip's life was too boring to say no, anyway.

After all, he'd walked down these apartment steps so often now, he could do so without a single thought in that near-empty head of his.

"Hello?"

He knew better than to go inside, but his assigned case was a disappearance, and the door had slowly opened upon his walking up to it, and had done so basically all on its own, so what else was he supposed to do?

The smell hadn't been horrible, but Phillip's nostrils were just as much in need of a constant state of comfort as anything else within his life, and so he did wince, and harshly, at least when he first walked in.

A thin layer of water, not a total flood, but at least a light one, sloshed below his feet within the carpet of every room.

But most importantly, there were papers, pages, and notebooks everywhere.

They covered nearly every surface of the house's space, and it would appear that all of these various pages had on them some sort of material that involved the written word.`,section:4,chapter:"Chapter 2"},{id:"219",symbolId:"phillip-bafflemint",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir - Chapter 2: The Flooded House",color:"#FFFF33",pageIndex:219,text:`Handwritten scratches of thoughts were etched across lined notebook paper organized around the space without a basic definition of rhyme, reason, or order. Printer pages scratched on by blue-felt tip pens appeared to be thrust into the air at random to simply fall where they may. Organized folders and notebooks of various colors with written notes and sketches held within them were stuffed into as many crevices as could be located within the excessively crowded space-couch cushions, the cracks between dresser drawers, tangled within piles of clothes. He even noticed that a few Moleskins were stuffed between the blinds of the living room's windows, as if these particular notebooks had been boomeranged out of a cannon of sorts-clearly of an explosive and not literary variety-and if anything, he honestly couldn't picture any other way they'd ended up in such odd positions? In fact, much of it all seemed as if some good samaritan had stuffed so much of the house's scattered pages and papers into firework casings so they could light a fuse, stick their fingers in their ears, and waddle off into some unknown land to-kaboom!-blast off! There were manuscript pages of printed text and articles all over the place held together by strained binder clips and staples which were struggling to hold their pages together and carry themselves across the rainbow bridge like a jockey trying to carry a sumo wrestler across a tightrope stretched taught between the Empire State Building and the fucking moon, as well as sketchbooks, maps, drawings, kabbalistic-looking outlines of various spheres connected by an array of etched lines and crosses, sticky notes, movie and plays scripts with detailed but hard to make out notes calligraphed upon their surfaces in some sort of red pen or ink, graph paper with various designs, notes, and a series of what appeared to be gestaltic repetitive designs swirled upon them, which when looked at closely revealed a negative space that one can't quite easily define because, after squinting for a just a little bit longer, the negative space which had been formed by the repetition of alternative shapes, would shift, to be replaced by the alternative shapes which had formed them, becoming the alternative themselves, and back and forth and back and forth, ad nauseam. Pencils and pens of various shapes, sizes, modes, colors, mechanical and/or plain-old-original styles were also scattered about and even stabbed into the walls in places which themselves seemed written upon in some sort of graphic or symbolic scrawl.

Sure, this was a maximal space, but if anyone was going to turn this cluttered disorder into a composed and organized minimalism, it was Phillip Bafflemint.

He could sense a quasi-religous urge pushing him forward, like a calling of some kind. It felt as if some higher-power not even yet contacted before by humankind, had tapped him on the shoulder to whisper in his ear, "Phillip, this place is a mess, and you've gotta be the one to clean it up."

He pulled his self-made playlist that had as many versions of Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1 on repeat as he could find, put headphones from his car into each of his ears, and got to work.

He'd wandered into the clutter of the house feeling like a bored moth drooling on their desk as attendance was being called, only to then see that a new student, Lighty McBulberstein, had joined the class, and they weren't just sitting nearby, but they were in the seat next to him.

And to interrupt my dear and astute reader-I apologize in advance for breaking this fourth-great wall to speak with you directly within one of the already very few (supposedly) realistic sections to have danced its way across our shared field of vision thus far, throughout this torn and tangled collection- but you may remember back in the first chapter, "an author's preface," that I'd claimed to be a sort-of Scheherazade in reverse. During this section, I'd explained that this meant that, rather than telling a long and convoluted story to keep myself from being killed only to find out later that I was to be protected, that I was telling a long and convoluted story that I would either be killed for telling, or that I would kill myself while creating -not suicidally, mind you, or at least if so, don't tell my therapist-and also not because of the difficulty of the task, but instead because all this twisted time and effort could be put in, and even if it ended up magical, redemptive, and sublimely beautiful, the corporate company I was thus satirizing could always just swoop down like a hawk with a hammer in its claws and squash any chance at these ideas being published like, well, like the moth Phillip was previously compared to. They do not fuck around with copyright. (Look it up!) For all I knew, and still know (or don't know), I could end up in the jaws of a gator at the bottom of Bay Lake! But again, this thought also came to me (or still comes to me, continually) that I was (or am) a Scheherazade in reverse, that rather than telling a story to save my own skin, that I was (and am) telling a story that could kill me, or a story which itself could be killed by the corporate conglomerate company in question, only to find out later that I had nothing to be afraid of to begin with, or so I, as an author, could only hope.`,section:4,chapter:"Chapter 2"},{id:"224",symbolId:"phillip-bafflemint",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir - Chapter 2: The Flooded House",color:"#FFFF33",pageIndex:224,text:`Upon writing this exact passage for you, my dear and astute reader, I've also still yet to find out for certain whether this narrative, or my own life, is to be cut from the light of life as if by the blade of Oren Progresso himself.

All this is to say, although it may seem strange for Phillip Bafflemint to snap into position with such a furious fervor, there is a precedent for such dream-like, risky, absurd, ridiculous, and beautifully self-delusional behaviors and positions, including the life of an author who, like Phillip, organized a similar collection in a similar manner.

The sub-and/or-unconscious mind has a mind of its own.

Sometimes it taps you on the shoulder, and other times it kicks you straight up the behind with a steel-toed boot.

And already ass-bruised from such a steel toe, as Phillip's organizing all those piling papers into stacks, he stops and notices a symbol, a set of symbols, a set which has already started cranking the leg backward again, catapult style, to swing forward, ready for Round Two.

The symbols seemed to radiate a dark and sinister secret.

It also explains the reasons for much of what is about to befall old Phillip, truth be told. Whether it be the iconically spiraled cochlea, or some other passageway within the inner ear's gnarled labyrinths, the slightest shift, fluid build up, or change to the inner ear's most sensitive of initial conditions can often prove to be disastrous.

And Phillip knows this better than anybody because, ever since he was a child, he's had a an ailment called Ménière's disease, a dysfunction within the inner ear that can cause debilitating dizzy spells, vertigo, nausea, hearing loss, and other disorienting complications due to the sensitive landscape nestled behind one's ear drum getting all a-fucked around with (or getting such fuckery genetically passed down).

He felt ridiculous, absurd, cliche-it doesn't get more cliche than a detective with vertigo spells, ladies and gentle-germs-but as The Author knows all too well, it was all true, or if not true, it was at least believable.

Surely there's gotta be some detective out there with Meniere's disease.

He waits in line for this twirling disorientation to slow.

The preliminary area of analysis which has left a mysterious impression on the current evaluator is the undecidability of whether or not The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, as a series of collective documents, were initially created as a work of fiction or were instead created as a set of works intended to document a contemporary reality. At the present moment, the sections that are under evaluation do not provide enough substantial evidence to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the work's fictive or realistic inceptions. However, the process of analysis regarding this set of documents has just begun, and there will likely be many future reports regarding this specific area of inquiry.

The area of concern which will be discussed in the next series of reports will be the possible identity of the text's unknown author. Within future investigations into the text's content, who and what the author may be, their possible gender, race, sexuality, methods, intentions, exigencies, and biases, each is bound to become an important and separate area for future analysis. Attached is the first document that will be used for analytical purposes, a section titled Jack Parlance Who Misses His Family. The content of this document alone already raises concerns about its unknown author's possible ties to Anti-Corporate and Anti-State ideas and activities, ideas that are clearly becoming more and more popularly circulated throughout the underground complexes of the theme park where both the current evaluator lives, and where, logically based on the location where The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey documents are continually being discovered, the unknown author also likely resides.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 1"},{id:"239",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 1",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:239,text:`The current evaluator mentions this detail of life within the underground complexes within this report before continuing their analysis of the text in question because it may become an important factor, as well as a possible subjective bias within the work of their continued analysis of the text in question.

Our field is dominated by data, our economy, society, and the underground tunnels where many of us live are monitored and ruled over by data. Because of this, keeping relevant and consistent documentation reigns supreme. As long as subjective experiences are documented, they can remain, at least in part, justified.

They have never left the park's underground passages due to Corporate Regulations against such possible actions.

This is another aspect of the document that puts the work's fictive and realistic elements into question, as mentioned earlier.

The thought first came to Jack on a previous Thursday, light ricocheting in through the blinds to splash perpendicular across the cream-white walls of his office, coming to him through the liminal zone between 4 and 5pm where it's quietly acceptable to leave the A.D.D. offices, a time which also holds the unspoken rule-what is an office without its unspoken rules?-that if one does leave between 4 and 5pm often enough, then one's work-ethic and reliability may increasingly come into question despite the fact that no one does anything at all between 4 and 5pm. Which is likely why, while waiting to stay in the office long enough to seem productive without having to actually do so, this thought came to Jack. It involved yet another thing missing from the game he hoped to code, something he decided the game may even be missing more than anything else: the concept of family.

And in this way, Jack was similar to the game he was hoping to create: he was missing his family. But it was less that he missed their presence from his life than he experienced their absence from it. Or even better, it wasn't that he was missing them, it was that he was missing from them.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"244",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 2",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:244,text:`Three years ago-a redundancy, aside from the corporate clock that hurdled them all through transportative blurs of ever increasing speeds, no one really kept track of time anymore, or at least no one had the capacity to any longer-Jack had abandoned his family. However, in his mind, they'd abandoned him. He felt he'd been left with no other choice but to do so. All he'd done was enact the bitter conclusion of all of their dysfunctional logic, a logic which had existed from the very beginning.

And maybe he was right?

Maybe they had and maybe it had?

Their initial protests to the contrary only ever seemed to reinforce this view of his.

But the realization-the missing piece of the game, incorporating the subject of family, that restless root that so much, so many, of his world(s) revolved around, but which for him, now represented only one rotating body of so many (and if so, within such a metaphor, what was then to become his sun?)-it provided no comfort to him, and if anything, it only caused him even more distress.

Family was the center of both Gibsey itself and Gibsey World, or it was certainly claimed and popularly admonished as being so. It existed as the subject of so many of its classics. From Tolstoy's repetitiously unhappy families to the infinite difference of Everything Everywhere All at Once, nearly every Gibsey product pointed back to the same thing: family.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"245",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 2",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:245,text:`Its absence from the game represented another idea he'd struggled to write, and would continue to struggle to write, let alone code, yet another problem which would be impossible for him to solve. How was he to consider how to incorporate his family, when the thought of them alone, itself, was too painful to even consider?

Everything he'd do from now on, ever since he'd left them, would go against everything he'd ever known before.

He was treading on new ground, the actual and terrifying new.

Maybe this meant he'd become what he and so many others had been hired to search for and stomp out, over and over again, within the limitless objectives given to them by the Agency of Data and Detection, which itself was only one of so many agencies of its kind within the M.A.S.S market.

Maybe he'd possibly become a subversive agent?

This was not what Jack had ever wanted to be.

If anything Jack wanted nothing more than for his existence to remain entirely obscure.

But subversive agents were never obscure.

The agencies, his world itself, the landscape, wouldn't allow them to be.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"246",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 2",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:246,text:`Or to put this another way, Jack didn't know very much about his world, but he did know that his professional life shouldn't at all be like his personal one. There should be a separation. His familial problems had been bad enough to begin with, so there was no reason not to try to whack-a-mole them out of his everyday experience, out of his memoires even, if he could.

And in this way he was, as he would always be, just like his family. He was (and is) a product of them, after all, and he was like them because he was, and often is, just as incapable of confronting himself as they were and still are. He may have been more capable of observing himself than they were, sure, but in reality, what difference did that make? As any writer, game developer, or storyteller well knows, there is a stark contrast between observing something and confronting it.

And this was an essential difference, it was maybe even the difference between a static and a dynamic character, if such definitions were worth being established, after all.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"247",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 2",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:247,text:`It was why agents such as himself were always expected to remain continuously objective within their work: to observe was to maintain order, and to confront was to change, subvert, and risk spiraling, splitting, into chaos.

It would not do, at all, could not be done, especially not by him.

He wouldn't do it, or certainly never intended to do so.

Of course not. How could it be? A.D.D. didn't have agency? It was its agents themselves which had agency, or they at least had enough agency that it was their responsibility to achieve such a balance. It was their own personal and individuated struggle to achieve this balance, a responsibility which proved they had agency to begin with, didn't it? And this meant, just like the job itself-his job being like so many if not all of the others-meant that one could only achieve such a balance if one was to observe rather than to confront, to maintain order rather than to subvert, to remain professional and never personal, to strive for happiness and never its alternative, despite any and all problems or symptoms which may present themselves, no matter what they may or may not be, and of course, none of this had (or continues to have) anything to do with the maintenance and power (or the maintenance of power) of the agency itself (meaning A.D.D. as agency, not Parlance's own; Parlance hardly had, or hardly has, any agency at all in the matter, as any observer could easily tell), and I, Jacklyn Variance, as the observer of this collection of data and an ADD agent myself, do find it essential, however discouraged it may within A.D.D. protocal, to insert myself here (with the purpose of long-term objectivity) in order to note that none of these observations are being made as intending to suggest anything negative or critical of the agency itself (meaning A.D.D.), whatsoever. None of what has been written, either within this document or within future documents, is intended sarcastically or flippantly in anyway, and therefore, I am trying, by saying so, to make my intentions clear that I am not in any way attempting to insert any sort of subversive actions into this analytic document pertaining to my current subject, Jack Parlance, and I am instead observing his capacity for subversive action, or his much more preferable lack thereof, if any is at all even possible.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"249",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 2",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:249,text:`From what I've laid out, it should be clear that the system which I 've been discussing in the recent passages of this Analysis Document is quite efficient, the truth of which has nearly become an objective reality itself, an entity, a corporation.

It is not the efficiency or inefficiency of our systems which is in question within this document, but instead, it is Parlance's individualized, differentiated inefficiency, his inability, yet again, to continue coding his game because more and more he's realized, or he's realizing, that there's an essential part of his game's story that's missing: his family.

Even games can tell narratives and create myths, after all, maybe even automatically so, before we've even created them, at least if they're based on rules that can be followed and recreated, remade, even before their time, structures waiting to animate form, to become form animated, like palaces of cumulative memory.

What is (and was) missing from Jack's imagined game was the concept and subject of family, and Jack's inability to include the concept of family wasn't only due to his inadequacies as a storyteller, but his inadequacies as a person, personal or professional.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"250",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 2",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:250,text:`Jack had abandoned the most essential of all Gibseyan themes: family.

Even if for good and justifiable reasons, what individual is capable of doing so without destroying themselves?

The magical bonds of family represented a bond so supposedly essential to one's personal development: attachment.

Or to put it another way: identification.

The possibility of both, of either, had now been severed for Jack, maybe even permanently.

One cannot attach oneself to oneself.

One must attach oneself to another, to an other.

What other reason was there to have such a Gibseyan emphasis on family?

Who in this universe of ours that we created for ourselves, by ourselves, would specifically choose to be alone, and all by one's choice?

Why else would one of the earliest, arguably most essential of all of the Gibseyan Mystic scriptures, a classic beyond all other classics, among others, why else would it involve that soft, vulnerable Italian deer, Bambino, forced to confront a similarly traumatic horror to Jack's? What else did it exist to say if it didn't intend to express the horror of the loss of one's familial bonds?`,section:5,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"251",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 2",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:251,text:`And what potent imagery?

There's nothing else like their freshness because there's nothing more beautifully detached than a new born baby. They are wholly and uniquely without agency. Their own agency must be taught, or if thought about in a slightly different way, must be theatrically reinforced.

And so the scene starts with those trepid follicles of grass, of grace, symbols of the new, the vulnerable new, not unlike Bambino, so small and innocent, so easily relatable, attachable, so susceptible to audience identification, chomping at the newness of spring.

"Spring grass!" Bambino blurts out with astonishment, noticing the little feast.

No, this observation would be an absurdity.

It's Bambino's innocence, even ignorance with which the audience identifies. The audience, be them children or adults-the boundary between the two, especially during this scene, while watching the loss of Bambino's mother, dissolving-and like all cyclical scriptures or Gibseyan classics, existing beyond time, and what is it to be a child or adult aside from a marker of time? How traumatic to have one's identity collapse, and so no wonder the brain compensates or confronts?

Audiences can't help but see themselves in Bambino.

It is the plummeting and accumulation of purity itself, which the spring has come to desecrate.

Spring, in such a context, is the coming death, the ever present death, here to obliterate the winter just as Bambino's mother is soon to be obliterated.

The ringing out of gun fire, the eternal slap of the shot.

To film is to hunt.

And it is not the camera which has agency, or the hunter's rifle which snaps winter into sudden wakefulness, which leaves Bambino to forever wander, this time, a wandering much different than the initial wandering caused by the wonder of spring.

And they will again.

It is eternal.

Bambino, both the character and the title of the film, not an uncommon choice in the early scriptures, is the saddest most memorable creature to have ever existed on screen.

But there is no blame.

There is no neglect.

There is no agency.

There is not even a true absence because the attachment, the essential attachment, was only ever theatre, and all Bambino is being forced to do is to confront the reality of their own eternal separation.

For Bambino, the fall of his mother (or her mother, as I, Jacklyn Variance, often thought, this reading being justifiable even objectively because as any audience member should know, women can identify with male characters just as males can identify with female ones), their mother, is a falling from life, the beginning of this fall, the inevitable plummeting of innocence, the plummeting of spring, the death that comes with the new.

And this is Parlance's horror, not the scene itself-he hasn't even seen the film before, bumbling consumer that he is, which the rest of us will be fated to experience and re-experience-but his horror can be posed as a question, this time, formed from much, much more than a singular noun.

Who would choose to abandon their own mother?

Jack Parlance would and did.

He has and still is, at least according to his family.

This made him some kind of monster, didn't it?

Or into one?

He'd done it all, and he'd done it to himself.

No Gibseyan film has ever existed that isn't about family.

To wander from such a subject was to wander to one's own death.

Family was Gibsey.

Close up of a patch of ice appearing, seemingly, out of nowhere.

This is not a forward moving of time.

This is a cycle in reverse, a movement backwards, a backward movement, a backyard, a retreat.

From conflict itself?

Wouldn't that itself be a conflict?

Unlike Bambino, he isn't entranced by the ice.

Having to see the ice is a tragedy.

He would rather forget.

He will choose to forget and already has.

It is too upsetting to even remember them.

His parents had lost something, as Bambino had, an innocence, but what he'd never realized before, and what he realized then, was that this loss assumed a connection, that a period of liberation, however brief, had once existed, and that he himself could, now that he recognized it, attempt to recreate such a period of liberation, if he wasn't even already experiencing it, repeating it, reflecting it, then, within the purity and newness of his innocence.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"262",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 2",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:262,text:`But he was no longer experiencing it.

One need not have children to lose such an innocence.

Anything at all could cause it to be lost.

The cause was not what mattered, but the effect, its universal sustainability.

And the images, those old videos, were like the memories he could no longer conjure up as inspiration for the game, despite even his knowledge of their power.

And there were so many.

Too many to name, let alone further identify.

None of this has even begun to mention his siblings.

He was the youngest of four.

His oldest sister, Brandi, sitting atop her white, wicker desk, staring at the framed photo of a violin surrounded in rose petals she'd hung on her wall; he'd always been told that he was her favorite.

And there was his sister Jennifer, 7 years away from him and closest to him in age, she'd affected him deeply, had shown him so much about what being alive would be like, for good or ill, represented so much of its best and worst possibilities, all he would want to either maintain or subvert, the hundreds of boardgames, the vacations and trips, putting on a raincoat to disguise himself and burst into the room while she was hanging with a group of her friends, and he'd been so disguised, so how could she've identified that it was him?

He hadn't understood this.

There was no confrontation that he was aware of?

How could there be?

He was a part of whatever he was observing?

He'd tried to explain this to them again and again.

He was a part of the family, was formed by it, had been brought into existence by it, and all he'd wanted to do was help them to be happy like they'd been before, to help them return to what he'd once seen, to ease the pain and horror of their seeming denial. He hadn't spoken of anything they weren't already aware of, or which they'd denied was real. What they'd denied was a willingness to listen to the observation to begin with.

They'd chosen not to identify.

The beginning of the end was when his siblings came to the decision to longer speak to him individually. It would be discussed as a whole family, or it wouldn't be discussed at all.

This provided no room, no possibility, for intimacy.

This move was, according to his siblings anyway, to preserve the family.

But he knew what it meant.

As a group, the family would continue to preserve itself, and this meant that nothing but public humiliation and shame was left for him to endure.

And thus, he'd become a sacrificial lamb.

And this was the worst of all possible outcomes.

Even their individual discussions had fractured into the trauma of nightmare, of mis-dis-and-ex-communication, the kind of nightmare where the subject, who is almost always yourself (but not always), tries to speak, is desperately trying to speak, only to find their voice silenced, stolen by some unknown entity, physically, mentally, or in some other more dreamlike capacity.

The exact content under discussion didn't matter, it never does, what matters is the force of the nightmare, its effect, which frightens you awake, but Jack is now awake without any dreams to wake up from into any alternative reality, or at least not that he has found or yet been made aware of.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"266",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 2",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:266,text:`And so he's come to believe himself as excommunicated, and maybe he even has been.

It could have been ideological differences, differences of a political or religious origin, his sexual orientation, or his choice of gender, or his views on sexual orientation or gender, or none of these things, and anything else. The content didn't matter. What mattered was the denial, the lack of identification, of whatever he'd brought to them, the effect. Miscommunication had transformed to an unspoken ex-communication, which led to Jack speaking and conjuring his own ex-communication into existence, all of it in some search for some kind of agency, and all of it had now left him not knowing how to write his family, or even the concept of family itself, into the game he'd hoped to code, but which he was never even coding.

Another of his many repeated failures.

All the refugees and refuges of the entire subversive underground, even it and they were also haunted, even if ultimately, it was they who were haunting themselves.

Who else could be doing the haunting?

Ghosts aren't some lonely unknown outsider trying to haunt the living.

And to think of them as such was to make the same mistake as the Parlance family.

They were always haunting themselves.

Because there was no outside.

You are always outside.

(It is a horrifying and traumatic business both the constructor of this document and Jack Parlance wouldn't wish on even their worst enemies).

Like Gibsey manufactures fantasy, parenting manufactures a complete and total lack of control.

To reform was not to transform.

After all, even revolutions involved a return to an original state.

What the Parlance family, including Jack, himself being a Parlance, and who would always be a Parlance, seemed (or seems) to misunderstand is that any remake would always contain traces of the original, and as a result, would always be haunted.

There was no avoiding the haunting.

Any attempt was to invite further haunting.

But hauntings themselves, weren't scary, weren't some outside terror here to destroy all things.

They were just somethings which came from other somethings, mishaps, accidents, ironies, magic.

Fantasies within fantasies within fantasies.

This narrative structure symbolizes a material reality within the theme park of our civilization, one material example of which is the growing ubiquity of continued training and education within the MASS markets (the Media Analysis State Services departments), a technique now used ubiquitously within agencies like ADD, if not especially within these sorts of agencies.

One no longer reaches a place of stasis, a place where one can rest, a vacation without end where one can be finished, or where one's work is finally complete.

Notebook on desk. Lamp on. Likely late evening.

He seems unaware that the focus of the film has now moved to him sitting in his hotel room apartment, unless his writing is intentional, which it may actually be. He's a known devotee of the more naturalistic and minimalistic communities dedicated to the ever-screening film, and being a devotee of the film himself, he's bound to find out sooner or later, depending on how long the focus remains on him, that he's now become one of its subjects.

But he may not have time.

The focus of the film is known to shift about incessantly.

But he also may already know the focus is on him, right this very moment.

He appears to be off the clock, meaning that he doesn't seem to be writing or collecting data for ADD at the moment-though this is debatable, as well, since all writing is a form of data collection-and he is instead doing some sort of writing exercise or reflection in his notebook about the movie itself.

An action such as this seems too obvious not to be an unintentional one, though interviews with other Cast Members familiar with Parlance, in particular, have revealed that he's known for his absentmindedness, flights of fancy, digressions, insecurity, indecisiveness, a lack of focus and awareness, that he's unable to stay on any given subject for an extended period of time, that-for example-his being under investigation as a possible SUBversive agent is entirely unknown to him, and many even think it suspicious that he works as a writer and data analyst for A.D.D., let alone that the focus has shifted to him within the film entirely, while the narrative is still unfolding, that he may even be in the process of becoming a major character.

Or she considers another possibility, is this some glimpse into a future event?

She's read many Data Reports on the sensation of deja vu, an anomaly of memory whereby one's recollection or sensation is centered around some sort of dreamed or not-quite-conscious experience that somehow remains sensed or processed as conscious despite its unconscious origin, defying one's sense of possibility. And like most experiences, this could happen at any time, at any point in someone's life, even at a younger age. And this is true, as Jacklyn remembers, if the memory is correct, a time in grade school, staring at her desk, convinced that her pencil was at an angle she'd seen before which existed outside of everyday reality, and her backpack had been there, as well, when she'd seen it, and the sound of her teacher's voice trailing off about some mathematical idea she suddenly didn't have the attention for. Why did it strike her with such familiarity?

However, this first observation doesn't involve full awareness of the thing being observed but instead involves a feigned sense of awareness, or a lack of awareness, distractions, lapses, or a distancing of oneself, one could say a separation. Although it might not quite make sense for this unconscious process to be consciously induced, it is, in fact, quite possible, and if anything, we do it all the time. Ever lost your train of thought? Ever started day-dreaming at work while the coffee's still steaming? Ever fell into a place that wasn't quite sleeping or waking, but was something else, somewhere else, entirely? There are entire places, such as Gibsey World, dedicated to inducing such states of mind in their viewers. It's a theme park, after all, a manufacturer of observations and excessive projections.

But the unconscious element is just the first step.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 4"},{id:"288",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 4",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:288,text:`After this observation is made-if "made" is even the correct term-a second observation is then necessary of the same material, and conscious awareness of this material is then implemented. The two observations are then combined into something other than their constituent parts, helping the observer, or analyst, to see things within their perceptions that would otherwise be unobtainable to their senses.

Something Jacklyn knows that very few of her ilk seem to be aware of, or at least most don't seem consciously aware of just yet, is that data analysis, retrieval, and observation is not factual, or at least certainly isn't entirely factual, because the "factual" material of one's observations are only what is taken in during the 2nd part of this process. Subjectivity may be discouraged, and even greatly frowned upon within A.D.D. discourse, but as Jacklyn has begun to reflect, and more and more everyday, this discouragement may not be to thwart or undo this said subjectivity, as is often thought; it may instead be to protect it. It's A.D.D. policy that the more unconscious one's 1st observation, and the more aware the 2nd observation, the better.`,section:5,chapter:"Part 4"},{id:"289",symbolId:"jacklyn-variance",title:"Jacklyn Variance, The Watcher, is Watched - Part 4",color:"#FF00FF",pageIndex:289,text:"And there was one more thing Jacklyn knew which she hadn't observed in most other agents, or which she at least hadn't seen just yet, maybe it would always be there, all along once she found it--it often is, maybe even always is, sitting there, waiting to be found by a willing observer-her key insight being that perception is essential to the experience, at least for any analyst worth their salt, because it's what animates the observation itself, what makes it uniquely hers, or theirs, and therefore what makes it a truly observed piece of analysis. Anyone can observe facts, list data, and repeat information. The agency has machines, clones, and intelligences of both artificial and extended means, as well as a few types yet-to-be-named since they're still in the process of their own development, all dedicated to collecting factual data of this kind at an increasingly rapid rate, feeding it back into itself, and multiplying. This was a theme park civilization built on the shoulders of the American empire, after all, shoulders that had been buckled down by the size and weight of all that had been collected from the very beginning.

It being based on one's individual perceptions, there was no ongoing training for how to implement and maintain such approaches, no customer service, no cast members to assist, no map.

Its threshold had to be entered into, alone.

You see something without seeing it, and then you look again, and so a splitting is involved.

"It's Preston."

But this wasn't Preston's voice on the other line. It was someone who knew Preston calling to tell her something she wouldn't understand, which would take her a very long time to understand, that she may never consciously be able to understand.

The most powerful forces, the truly powerful forces, are the ones which escape all perceptions entirely, and if anything, this was why the process of maintaining one's perception was so important, to keep these forces at bay.

How had it happened?

How could she have been so careless in her perceptions?

Was there something she could have seen?

Some piece of data trapped in her memories that could unlock it all, that could help her go back, to transform the past that led up to this moment?

Nothing could have prepared it.

Nothing.

And of course, that's why it'd been so hard for him to finish and so hard for everyone else knowing what would now forever be fated to be withheld from their world.

Days before, she'd talked to him on the phone quite a bit actually, a little bit more than normal, but not in any sort of way that seemed out of the ordinary. They talked on the phone quite often, after all, so she hadn't thought it out of the ordinary.

How could she have known?

Did she?

Did Preston?

Of the many details, the data, the facts observed secondarily, which she remembers constantly and repetitively now, from those talks, the most important detail, or the one which has stuck with her the most, was the title of a film Preston said he'd wanted to make.

And all he did was see.

He was a man of vision, one could say.

"Do you know what a Splitter is?" He'd said to her.

"What? The movie?" It's late, but talking to Preston does usually get her in touch with a side of herself she doesn't get to see very often, the side where she can finally give herself a damn break for once, and so she needs a drink, wants one, and goes to the kitchen and makes one for herself. Phone in hand, against her ear, she drinks and wanders the tile of the kitchen floor like a labyrinth. They continue talking and she traces the lines of the squares, trying to stay focused on Preston's accumulations.

"Yeah. It's about establishing a form of communication between people struggling to communicate." He'd mentioned this plot to her before, but she can't remember it, can't place it.

To issue new shares (of stock) to existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings.

To end a marriage or an emotional or working relationship.

A branch of science concerned with classification, such as the classification of organisms, though it can also be used to create an index of knowledge stored as documents, articles, videos, records of data, so that users can access information more readily.

Here is a director.

He wants to place you in the most creative, the most pleasurable, the most bang-for-your-buck, immersive bit of adapted vacational landscape in all the theme parks of Gibsey World, and this director, Marvin Scrillio, I'm standing on his set.

I'm watching him.

I'm fulfilling that myth of CEO as reader, standing there, watching him with a book under my arm, a novel, An Unexpected Disappearance, A Glyph Marrow Mystery, to be exact, and more about that specific text later.

I'm trying to act inconspicuous, not saying much, acting as if I'm not there, hoping to blend into the background, though there's nothing I can do, really, to be truly out of sight since my appearance is, on sets anyway, almost always noticed, if not expected. I'm the CEO of the whole damn thing, and not just of the company, mind you, but of the whole damn civilization, every part of it, big or small, above or below. All of it is mine to control and manipulate, not that I always achieve this control or manipulation, mind you, but I try. Gibsey World is my domain, so when I speak, when I poke my head in, when I give a nod or make my assessments, people perk up, artificial morale boosts, destructive behavior plummets, ass cheeks clench, and anxiety ensues. Even Scrillio, pompous ass that he is, director of this adaptation of the obscurely epical poetical novel he's renamed Wonderful Worlds has got to get his shit together because, when I'm on set, everyone notices. you have to notice, immediately.

You never know in my business with so many obsessive types. We all adore the movies, don't we? Why else would we have gotten into this business? But Scrillio, pretentious ass that he is, seems to think he's got some kind of special love for it, that he's the only lover of the movies we've got left, like it's a monogamous relationship or something, as if that could ever happen with the polymorphous variance that is the movies. Why else do you think when a camera moves left or right that we call it a pan?

I do feel for him, at least in some ways, with all that pressure on him, this being his third film after he revolutionized the industry with his first adaptation of The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, and when his second film bombed after so many of those disasters all fell upon us, The Tempestuous Storm. Even I can admit, the failure of his second film wasn't his fault. Even I could see that.

I may be CEO, but I'm not a fucking animal.

I can absolutely feel for others!

I can even empathize with them!

However, I'm not planning on showing him that empathy, mind you.

Not if I'm going to get what I want.`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"314",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:314,text:`Not if I'm going to get the budget cut which is the real reason why I'm there, on set, why I'm willing to be there, even as CEO of this whole thing.

And the budget of this thing.

My fucking god.

That was the real spectacle of it all.

You really should've seen it, should've been there, on set, to see it, as it was all happening.

There may have even been an actual goddamn golden age, and you know what?

That golden age?

It's fucking now.

This set he's gotten them to build, I mean, that he's gotten me to build, goddamnit-it's pretty much a full scale replica of the park entrance way of The Magical Dominion park, down to the smallest detail. It's as accurate as it could possibly be. A full simulation of the original. Down to the letter.

It might even be better than the original, could replace the original if it needed to, not that it ever will.

And you can see it, being in that landscape.

It's undeniable.

Life imitating art, art imitating life, and back again, and honestly, by that point, I don't know if anyone could tell the difference. Which, I mean, to give him his due, is probably what Scrillio was going for. I mean, I'll be honest. Scrillio's the one who demanded it be this detailed, after all, and with the budget on the damn thing skyrocketing through the fucking roof, him being The Last Auteur and everything.

Gibsey, it was fucking bull shit

But you know what? Even though I'm frustrated with him, even if the budget is climbing past the atmosphere, Arieol, I've got to admit, have to, it's certainly well done, high quality, top notch stuff, truly, but you know, also, like I've said, Scrillio's also losing it.

They always do at some point, don't they?

He's clearly cracking under the pressure.

But however dangerous it is, and I mean, my Gibsey, is it fucking dangerous how high this budget is getting, especially with him losing control like this, but however dangerous it may be, I do respect his commitment. As CEO, I may not like it, but I gotta respect it. I mean, come on, I'm a CEO.

My fucking Gibsey!

And the crew's getting really worried by this point.

They've all put up with a lot by now, to say the least, and I'm gonna have to find some leverage somewhere.

It's started to get very, very serious, Ariel.

During dailies, Scrillio hasn't been keeping the shots straight and together in his mind like he used to, even with his script supervisor being as clear as possible with him, going over the notes in detail, like I am with you, explaining to him with as much precision as possible which sequence or shot he's being shown at any given time, even with everyone in the room anticipating his reaction, he seems to be hallucinating images entirely, rather than the one's he's being shown. What I mean is that, when he describes the dailies back to members of his crew, entire sequences within his perception seem to have replaced the original sequences. It's as if he isn't even seeing what's actually there, like he's somehow watching another film other than the one that he himself shot, like it was also being shot simultaneously.

And how do you create that kind of film and watch that fucking movie?

That's what I want to fucking know.`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"318",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:318,text:`And day before last, during lunch, a PA heard him weeping, quietly weeping, by himself, behind a curtain, and earlier in the morning, a sound technician heard him angrily punching dents into the restroom walls. They're all getting very concerned about him. You can tell just by being there, being on set, that the crew and the cast members are worried, but they're all keeping real quiet about it, not saying anything to each other, keeping it all hush-hush, and especially out of the media.

They're worried.

They're really fucking worried.

And no one knows what to do or say about it, and so that's why they call me on set with that book still under my arm. Oh, and I guess I've mentioned this book once already, so I can go ahead and give you some context. The studio's thinking about adapting it, that book I'm carrying with me. An Unexpected Disappearance is what it's called. It's a pretty well reviewed detective novel from what I understand. It's not important for me to go into detail right now. I don't think it's necessary for the script, but who knows, maybe it'll become necessary later? I can get into it later, but, well, I don't know if it's my thing, honestly, the book, I mean. It's too experimental for my taste. The main character's one of those deeply flawed characters, mentally speaking, and so the narrative's all over the place regarding the structure, the POV--not my sort of thing in the slightest-and I'm sure you know how that's such a popular trope these days-that sort of constantly moving, attention-deficit-disorder-type narrative-structure that never stays in one place at one time, that's always changing that's very episodic, that sort of thing. And I get it, I get the appeal. It's just not my taste. But you're a CEO or whether you're the last auteur, you've got to go with what it is that people want, and so I have to read it and understand what makes it appealing, at least partially, even if it just isn't my thing, and from what I can tell, I think it's supposed to reflect how our brains work, maybe, or something about our civilization, about ADD, about intelligence, and I mean, with the audience's attention spans these days, it's not exactly unrealistic.`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"319",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:319,text:`This is Gibsey World we're talking about.

We manufacture and decimate attention spans, simultaneously.

It's what we've always done.

Oh, and by the way, like I've said, CEOs can and do actually read.

Michael Eisner was a goddamn English major for Gibsey's sake!

But I'm getting distracted, aren't I?

I need to return to the set.

It's very Busby Berkeley-esque in style, what he's shooting, very dense, almost nauseatingly so.

I mean, the fucking budget on this thing!

Have I mentioned that?

"I'm just terrified we're going to have another one of those tragically-misunderstood-but-eventually-becomes-a-cult-classics on our fucking hands.

He has this minimal outfit he's worn for weeks, plain black t-shirt, cargo shorts, real-director-like, the fucking dork that he is, and he's clearly not been washing himself, let alone his clothes, his gray mop of hair's even more disheveled than usual, his bug-eyes even more bloodshot, the wrinkles of his skin cracking into further wrinkles, and each of those forming an entire map of exhaustion that most of our eyes are either forced to dart away from or are drawn to like a moth to a film projector, but despite all this, despite the smell and his overall demeanor, the crew members, they're all still Scrillio's ever-vigilant troops, his evangelists and loyal companions. They've seen him through this chaotic process so far, and they're going to try to continue doing so.

They always do, don't they?

It concerns me a little bit for humanity when I see it, at times, when I see it happening like this, but I mean, I'm a CEO for Gibsey's sake. I know better than just about anybody that, at least in the right hands, they're what keeps this shit afloat, am I right?

It has to happen!

What's the line?

What was it?

Was it from The Tempest?

Yeah, yeah I think it was The Tempest.

Oh, yes, it's The Tempest, that Gibseyan classic. It's gotta be.

"Where's the master? / Play the men."

Yeah, that's the one.

And you gotta admit, Arieol, that's a good line.

I'm a CEO, and I fucking read!`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"321",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:321,text:`Well, to get back to it, he has this opening sequence he's tried to get right again and again and again.

Cut. Action. Cut. Action. Cut. Action.

Over and fucking over again.

It's making me nauseous to watch it.

It really is.

And to explain, it's done out of order, I mean when they're shooting it, out of sequence obviously, but I'll try to see if I can reconstruct it for the Saving Mr. Banderas script. From what I remember, the chorus of the theme song started at the top of the scene, and Gibseydammit. You have to understand, I heard this set of lines probably hundreds of times while on set. It's why I remember them so well. I was there more than just one day, ok? I'm just reconstructing this for the narrative to function. Let me see, I think it went something like:

Welcome, welcome, welcome!

Welcome, welcome, welcome!

And by the way Arieol, I'm sure you know, but in case you don't, this is the theme song that plays at the beginning of the morning at the park when it opens, outside the entrance way of The Magical Dominion.

Think of it as opening credits for the park.

Or like a footnote.

Yeah, like an endless footnote that just keeps on going and going on forever, stretching on and on, until the end of time.

And this is what he's going for, the fucking imbecile.`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"322",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:322,text:`Going to Gibsey World is like entering a movie, like being inside a movie, literally.

It's like a living movie, like being on set, behind the screen, back-stage, as they call it.

I mean, it's funny to think about, isn't it?

Oh, and did I mention the drool that's started to hang out of Scrillio's mouth by this point?

I shit you not.

Whole globs of it, the slob that he is, and in front of the whole crew!

I mean, what a fucking imbecile!

And, oh shit, actually Arieol, maybe be careful about writing that detail down.

I'm not saying it's a sexual thing or anything.

He isn't ogling at anyone.

He's just, well, he's incapacitated, or he at least seems to be.

Just make that clear.

He's just mentally incapacitated or something

I don't want to be misunderstood by future viewers.

And god forbid I'm misunderstood by future viewers. Shit do they just love to misunderstand you these days, don't they?

And you know what?

They use that misunderstanding to gain power for themselves, don't they?

That terrifies me, Arieol, terrifies me to no end.

They're becoming the real masters now, Arieol, these readers, the viewers, the public.

I mean, by Gibsey, we may have actually lived up to our Gibseyan creed after all, giving them all that power.

It terrifies me to no end.

But you cut what you can cut.

And you have to.

And if there's anything I don't want in this scene, Arieol, it's that, what I just said, so don't put that in the script. Got it?

OK?`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"323",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:323,text:`Now, to continue.

I'm there to cut the budget.

The cast members enter from backstage, and their movements.

My Gibsey, their movements, let me tell you, they're about as calculated as the late-Victorian architecture that surrounds them. I mean it, Malt Gibsey, they're good. They're all top notch performers. They're these twisting, twirling columns, these perfected monumental smiles. They're like moving statues, adorned with makeup and whimsy, and they're dancing so well, and singing like goddamn angels. They could rival the cast members of the actual park, mind you, and they do. Maybe even better.

God you should've heard them.

You should've seen them, really. You should've been there, Arieol.

It was truly wonderfully done, but no matter how on point they are, no matter how well they're hitting their cues, Scrillio doesn't seem to think it's going the way he wants it.

Cut this, cut that.

Fuck this, fuck that.

But they just keep going on with the scene, trying to get the section for the opening theme song the way this fuming, narcissistic, imbecilic last fucking 'auteur' wants it.

Fuck those goddamn articles.`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"324",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:324,text:`Oh, and I didn't mention this.

But this is where these articles have gotten him.

He's gotten to the point where thinks he needs a fucking orchestra performing on set while he's shooting the damn thing!

Did you hear what I just told you?

He thinks he needs to score the thing as it's being shot, live!

Did you hear what I just said?

Told the producers it would give the performances more of a dream-like quality. That's what he fucking said, and of course they nodded their stupid fucking heads and pretended like they knew exactly what he meant.

Gibseydamn, the fucking budget on this thing could give somebody a fucking heart attack!

And I'm medicated to kingdom come, Ariel, you know that I am.

I'm goddamn CEO!

And so the cast members continue on through the medley, the shoot, mostly in sequence by this point, which isn't really the norm, but they're doing it anyway.

You know, normally you shoot the beginning last and the ending first, that sort of thing, or you even just shoot when people are available on set, which is arbitrary. It's different every time, but Gibsey, he's the last auteur so he's gotta do it exactly the way he wants it. And they just keep performing the same parts again and again and again, doing the different parts of the same scene over and over again as they continue.`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"325",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:325,text:`I'm forgetting. Where does the theme song go next? I think it's something like:

We are here to give our dreams To every boy and girl, A place so big that you might scream Or maybe even hurl, Castle beyond an entrance way To hold yourself aloft, Step inside our movie set, And turn your brain right off!

And look, I know I'm kind of having to reconstruct this for you in order for you to get it in the script, so it's a little confusing for me to remember. I said it was in sequence, but trust me, it wasn't like that during the process, not at all. It wasn't even remotely in order, or if it was, it was so fucking repetitive you couldn't even tell!

Picture this.

This director, this fucking supposed auteur, is hallucinating and regularly. Do you understand me? It isn't orderly what's been going on, what he's been doing.

No, not at all.

It's fucking chaos, but anyway, interrupting this, well it wasn't an interruption since it was a part of the thing, as well, but I mean interupting the scene, the performance, interrupting it is an announcer, an unseen voice, a recorded voice, like it does at the park entrance theme song.`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"326",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:326,text:`An announcement is made. Like I said, it was all totally authentic and just like the original, the music swelling, the cast members high-fiving each other as the voice comes in to say:

Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, Welcome to the Magical Dominion!

And you know me. I'm not easily impressed, Ariel. I know this will surprise you, but most of the time, I'm faking my enthusiasm. In fact, that's probably the most common part of my job.

Internally, I'm hardly ever impressed.

But the positive energy of those performances, I mean, it becomes undeniable for me in that moment, Arieol. Something special is going on there, and I can't deny it. I don't have to fake anything, and it all starts becoming our collective energy, all of us within that landscape, all of us on set. It's really starting to affect us all by that point. At least all of us but Scrillio, of course.The cast members, they're all really doing well, but this director, he just can't see it, or he can't ever seem to believe it while it's happening right in front of him, right in front of his very eyes. And I mean, I'm breathing it all in as best I can, even with those budget cuts in mind. You see, Arieol, I'm a fucking adult. I'm not some man-child director trying to affix this bull shit scene to my fucking career. I can see that there's something infectious about this place, about Gibsey World, and his reconstruction of it.`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"327",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:327,text:`You have to give yourself over to it, at some point, even if it is a work of adaptation, believe me.

It really was and is the most magical place on Earth, or at the very least, it was certainly as vivid a recreation of it as could possibly be made at the time.

And so they start the next refrain:

You'll have a good time, just leave it up to us. Welcome to a place where dreams are born. The price is worth it, we promise, you will see!

Where uncomforting, difficult thoughts disappear, The most magical place on earth is here!

Scrillio is using these really wide angle lenses, but the DP, his director of photography, wants to zoom in further for this next part since the melodies of the song are going to shift to the cadence from a, uh, a classic, a, uh-oh what was the musical? Singing, singing? Oh I can't think of the name of it.

And imagine my frustration seeing this happen within the context of this budget, seeing this pompous asshole unsatisfied with all this that's being done all on his behalf while our investment is playing out right in front of all us, and I truly don't know, can't even begin to understand what Scrillio doesn't like about it. I think there's something wrong with him. Knowing him, it probably has something to do with the "realism" he doesn't like. Gibseydamn it, the multiple imbecilic discussions we've had about that Gibseydamn concept.

But the actors, the voices, the performances of the cast members, like all experiences in Gibsey World, they're all heightened.

They're beyond the norm.

A regular voice? Or a casual welcome to an audience? That, for a recreation of Gibsey World? Nope, that's simply not enough.

This is a world of magic that must be created and recreated in real time, that must be manifested again and again, continually.`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"329",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:329,text:`These are communication systems we're working with here, Arieol.

Warp and weft.

Nothing here is ever truly enough, is ever going to be enough. There's always going to need to be more of whatever there is.

And think about that, the pressures I'm under as CEO to create that magic that's supposed to be happening all the time here.

And, you see, that's why I said I respect Scrillio so much because of what he's doing, even with the fucking budget, it's very Gibseyan what's he's doing to a certain degree, even though he's on the edge, even though he's losing it, smelling like shit, eyes bulging, the outbursts.

At least he's dreaming as far as he can dream.

I can goddamn respect him for that, Arieol, and he and the DP are still barking at one another about the lenses, quietly of course, since the sound is still rolling, and the scene continues again and again, and the medley continues, repeating itself, a version of a version of the original song having to start back over again.

Good mornin', Good mornin' Please let me sleep. Gibsey, I'm nearly through. Good morning, good morning, to you.

Kubrick on acid.

Think about that one for me.

Picture it if you can.

We're talking about one of the most infamous, notoriously demanding and frustrating pain-in-the-asses to work with in all of movie history. Time basically slows to a stand still when you do a scene on his set as many times in a row as he does, and as an actor or crew member on a set like that one, you have to start to wonder if you aren't going to be enveloped in total darkness by the end of it all.

Do you understand what I'm telling you here?

It would probably start to seem like it would never end, like a black hole would appear to swallow up the entire universe.

And maybe when he directs, it does.

And what I'm saying is that Scrillio's even worse than that!

Even worse, I'm telling you!

Do you understand what I'm saying Arieol?!`,section:6,chapter:null},{id:"332",symbolId:"oren-progresso",title:"The Last Auteur",color:"#00FFAA",pageIndex:332,text:`"He's got to have some issues with death or something!

But I don't need to be wasting money on another man's therapy, do I?

I have my own issues to contend with, a whole civilization's worth to contend with, in fact!

At a certain point it just seems like he's just making up reasons he doesn't like the shots, the performances, the angles, the reasons they need to be done over and over, again and again.

It's getting really ominous at this point.

All kinds of health and ethical codes are being violated.

And you'd think I'd step in, being CEO of this thing, and seeing this happen right in front of me. I mean, it's why I was asked to be on the set in the first place. And you'd think that I would've, but I don't.

I have to let it all play itself out.

You see, I'm building a case.

I'm building evidence.

I'm collecting data.

There's no: "Please, oh, please let me stay swaddled in my fucking man-child cacoon, please, oh please, oh please!"

Nuh-uh.

Nope.

None of that shit.

Once he crosses a certain number of lines, I'm the one who gains complete and total control.

And so I have to wait.

I can't lower the budget on 'the last auteur' just because he smells bad and his hair is disheveled!

I don't want to come across as pessimistic to my future audience, Arieol. That's the last thing I want. I- just-uh, I'll, uh, I'll just-I'll return to the scene.

They finish this section on this longer refrain of the chorus before transitioning to the next one, and Scrillio's way, way out there, forcing them to do it over and over again.

Like I've said, the exhaustion that's been building up on set, it's getting worse and worse.

And the performers, they're starting to crack under the pressure themselves, but they're holding on to it, for now, holding on to the final refrain of this section, and they just keep having to hold it, note after note, again and again and again.

A train enters the scene.

Petey Puff, one of the classical Gibsey characters, you know, the comical part-human-part-pot-leaf doofus with glasses and a shrill voice-you've heard of him, I'm sure-hangs off the train as it's pulling up, emitting steam and light.

Petey Puff jumps down from it and into the scene in progress, clumsily tripping over themselves as they enter, their stammering voice interjecting into the choral group that's singing alongside them, narrating their entrance.

Petey Puff is comin', comin' down the track 'Hey, where the smoke is at? I need it for my back!'

This Petey Puff costumed cast member's playing this classic bumbling idiot, this fool, and they're playing them perfectly, stumbling around awkwardly, looking stoned as hell, not knowing where to go. It's fucking fantastic.

Some of us, on this set, we're doubled over at this point. We're holding our sides, trying not to let out air and accidentally interrupt the sound that's being recorded.

He's just that good.

Like I've said, they're doing a fucking great job, a fantastic job, the cast members.

And another cast member enters, costumed as a police officer, from stage left with a set of handcuffs, and places them over Petey's wrists.

"Hip-hip-hooray!" Each member of the chorus holds an arm up in triumph at the theater of Petey's capture and the shooting of the theme song continues. Scrillio shakes his head all the while, mouthing "It's not right. Not right. Not right at all."

And I know it'll be worth it.

And so I keep waiting it out.

Two cast members enter the scene holding a set of prison bars and set them before Petey. The police officer who handcuffed him takes out this comically large set of keys and pretends to lock the cell, throwing the keys offstage. Petey's glasses fall off and onto what is supposed to be the cell floor, and this actually isn't a part of the originally written scene either, by the way, the falling off of the glasses. I think the glasses fell off the costume itself, but the cast member, the one playing Petey, the thing is, they're a master improviser. They just go with it: 'Can someone help me find my glasses?

Gibseydamn it, they're good!

It was just so Petey Puff, you know?

But it's clear it wasn't intentional, which you can only tell by being there, Ariel, by being on set, not that that matters because Scrillio's already yelled cut, been yelling it, again and again.

He's freaking the fuck out.

"Does no one believe in the script anymore!?'

I'm really having to hold back my own anger, and it's starting to feel like the crew members are having to do the same, as well, and Scrillio's sensing it too.

They looked flat out demonic!

It's Dickey Dog I'm talking about here-the Dickey Dog.

He can't be ignored.

He jumps aboard the stationary train, the classic train of the park, of The Magical Dominion, and a family of four stands next to him, smiling from ear to ear.

He doesn't even stop.

All the characters from the show enter one last time, the cameras pulling out, and the DP's got a few others with fisheye lenses there to capture the whole scene from a distance, from every conceivable angle. I mean, the budget on this goddamn thing!

Scrillio's eyes fill with tears.

His mouth trembles, the fucking man-child that he is. You can hear him sniffling, and he doesn't care. He just lets it happen, watches it happen, like I am, being there, on set, and all together, in unison, all of the cast members unite, in triumphant glee:

Sctillio's done it. He's accomplished his goal. He's finished the scene. He's made it to the end, and he even seems satisfied with it for once.

There's nothing wrong with emotions.

It's that space between space, being in that moment. It's liminal. You scramble. Your eyes dart all over the board. And you ask yourself, what could you have done to prevent this? Was it inevitable? And what do you do now that the move's been made? You scroll through your various options. Your heart pumps blood. You twitch.

The number one thing I want to avoid is a long argument with Scrillio. Especially after his most recent film, that massive flop, that box-office travesty, The Tempestuous Storm. God, the arguments we had over that one. And don't get me wrong. Like I've said, I'll say it wasn't his fault, it being made during a time of such social and political upheaval, the famines, the diseases, the ecological disasters, the evacuations, the violence. It wasn't his fault what happened during the production and reception process of that film, but it's best not to have him be aware of that fact. His ignorance, or maybe you call it his innocence, it must be maintained. It must be restored, continually. It's better to keep pushing him. I have to keep pushing him, punishing him. I've got to. With how difficult it is then, with the difficulty of dealing with him, and the pressure getting even worse now, the thing is, he needs that pressure, and so does the budget, the lowering of the budget especially.

The various hospitals and old folks centers she'd visited, usually with her mother, the dank smell of loneliness that had dominated the hallways, the wrinkled skin and boney fingers. the hallowed out look of burdening dementia, the floating forgetfulness, lathering itself, progressively, across every layer of their final experiences.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"356",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:356,text:`Thinking of these moments, again, at this stage within her life, these memories take on a new meaning because, to be cloned and to then become the original version of herself was, in a way, to become like the dead, or at least, like her grandparents, to face death before its more natural occurrence.

She'd expected this to be a good thing and technically, she supposed it was.

It was certainly promised as such, but like so many truths of the procedure, things had not gone as expected or promised, at least not internally. Externalities, as always, had presented themselves. The procedure was supposed to give her more time, to give her the opportunity to distance herself from the complexity and preconditioned obligations of her previous life, to open up whole new worlds for herself which she could live in separately, without worry or anxiety, like an endless vacation, at least it was marketed as such, and although it had created an artificial or extended version of these promises and these promises seemed to have come true from the outside, internally, all it had really opened up for her was a portal to an endless past, decay, a reformation and spiraling into death rather than an escape from one.

But the marketing had at least been partially accurate, she could admit, because she certainly did have plenty of time on her hands.

If anything, all she had was time.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"361",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:361,text:`She could do whatever she wanted, but she often found that, if anything, she had too much time. All her life represented now was a series of interconnected failures, all the ways she would continue to fail and fall short of, all that she was incapable of that her cloned self was out there doing, all she would now be forced to leave behind.

Either to comfort herself or to send herself further into doubt and worry, she wasn't sure which (and depending on her mood, it really could be either), she would often pull up the transcripts and lectures that her cloned self had recently completed within her recent courses to read and re-read them, sometimes simply reading them on their own, sometimes to compare them with the transcripts of her original lectures, other times even re-reading them to the point where she could recite their passages from memory.

What else did she have to do with her time but to create a memory palace for herself to wander in and out of, discovering the similar ideas and differences between the two, as well as the strange places where both struck chords of both unexpected and cliche originality?

Wasn't this what she had been promised?

Or was it something else?

Sometimes, she would even slip into the transcripts without thinking, mostly when she was feeling isolated or alone, which was basically all the time, for the original version of Natalie, at least.

And such moments would begin, as follows:`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"362",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:362,text:`Hello. Welcome to my course, An Introduction to Gibseyan Mysticism. I'd like to mention, from the start of this lecture, that this is a popular course. I admit, from the start, it may be strange for me to mention this course's popularity. It may also be strange to admit that we will be drawing heavily from my most famous book, Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism, which is also the name of this course. Now, I don't mention this course's popularity and the title of this book to brag about my book's success, or I at least don't intend to do so. Instead, in mentioning this, I'm attempting to begin by pointing out an irony, and a rather profound one, one that can be seen both within this course and within this book's popularity, this irony being that mystical traditions such as the Gibseyan Mystical tradition, the tradition with which I will be introducing you to today within this introductory course, as well as within the next series of lectures, that these traditions are not popularly practiced. It may be popular to read about, yes, and even popularly discussed. Much of its content is even spreading all over the place both in person and online, across various platforms, at a near constant, even arguably exponential rate. And yet, it's so seldom practiced in daily life by so few of us. It's certainly not often reported as being regularly practiced.

Which leads to a final irony, before I begin, a conflict, the idea that to speak about such subjects is to negate their purpose, that upon speaking, that I have already entered into a kind of illusion. I have created a theme park, so to speak. A theme park is not the real world. Rather, it is the reflection of the real world, one which is within our current world. This is an idea which is easy to forget. Even within own current world, our current system, where a theme park has replaced the world entirely, where our entire world, the spaces we roam, traverse, live, eat, and sleep, be them the liminal, sub-liminal, or everyday spaces which we inhabit, each of them, all of them, have been transformed into theme park locales that are building and rebuilding themselves, endlessly. We have become translations of theme parks, adaptations of theme parks. We have been subsumed into a corporate entity. We have become monopolized into a single harrowing mass, but even despite this, even despite this context of each of our lives, the irony I will begin with, within this course, or which I will end this introduction to the course with--is that even that world of which I speak, which I refer to, is not the real world. And even what I speak of now, what I am currently saying to all of you, is not the real world. I may never, ever be able to speak, within any of my lectures, of any sort of real world.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"363",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:363,text:`I'd like to read a passage from the book I mentioned earlier, and I admit now-do be prepared-this is a book which I may draw from on occasion, if it isn't too arrogant for me to do so, or if it is arrogant to do so, if you can please forgive me for doing so: "Whatever is real may, in fact, never be spoken of. The true mystical experience is not one which can ever be truly repeated or recorded but can only be referred to, inferred, or experienced." This lecture therefore, what I've titled, The Contradictions of the Mystical Gibseyan Experience, should not be taken as a direct glimpse into mystical experience itself. This lecture isn't even a report of a mystical experience. It is this and only this: it is a set of data, a series of codes, on and off switches, a Gibstory, a map of a theme park, a map that you, yourself-should you choose to break out of the traditions many of your peers have chosen to trap themselves within-will set you on a mythical and mystical traversal. It is a map that you yourself will have to experience subjectively upon learning of or viewing the data which I will present to you today.

And one last comment before I continue, being a new teacher with you today, after all, I want to mention a motto of mine, a mantra of sorts, one last reminder, my true last ironic reminder, and the ultimate reminder. It is a motto I've stolen, or maybe it would be better to say I've adapted, from a previous professor of my own. "There is nothing I can teach you that you don't already know."

And so with this said, and upon mentioning this motto of mine, or of my previous professor's, let's see what you already know, shall we?`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"364",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:364,text:`Now, I'd like to return to a word that I used earlier, in multiple contexts, one which will be our constellation point for this next series: Tradition.

I referred to Gibseyan Mysticism earlier as a tradition, which again-sorry to repetitiously and continually use this term-is ironic. Another irony within the previously mentioned one is that Gibseyan Mysticism is an unpopular tradition, a tradition that is not widely practiced, a contradiction in terms, and therefore, as a religious practice, it has largely been ignored by popular Gibstory.

And being a popularizer of this tradition, I've been spoken of as a trailblazer within my department. Some have claimed that I'm some kind of revolutionary, here to restore the Gibseyan Mystical tradition on a wider scale than has ever been done before, and though I'm flattered by this description of myself, this can't ever be true. It's a myth. Yes, I've published books on the matters which I will be discussing in these lectures, and yes, I teach this very popular course. This is all true. But much in the same way I cannot teach you what you already know, I also cannot popularize something that cannot become and will never become popular.

It can't be because it isn't in its nature to be so, and it never will be.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"365",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:365,text:`I would symbolically typify Gibseyan Mysticism as something that is almost apocalyptic and world ending.

It resembles a field of overgrown ruins.

It's like a theme park that's been reduced to rubble, to tatters, to nothing. It is an empty space that was once intended to be inhabited that now only a very occasional traveler stumbles upon to be shocked by some bizarre image of the sacred that's repellant to rational thought.

It's like a set of eyes.

It's the intertwining of two realms, the individual and the collective, or another, which will become one of the major themes of this lecture, the traditional and the progressive. Gibsey himself was described this way within many of the various contradictory and still-trembling-with-life Gibseyan religious scriptures: as a conservative trailblazer, a man of realism shackled to illusion, inundated with both the past and the future, tradition and progress, these interests of his even animating many of the texts he, himself, created, or which he had others create.

And a proper understanding of them requires us, as aspiring mystics within this course, to hold both possibilities, however contradictory, within our minds, at any given time, the fantastical and the Gibstorial, the religious and the scientific, the mystical and the traditional, and if taken together, they will promise valuable findings for the work we will be doing together within this course.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"366",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:366,text:`To assume that Gibseyan Mysticism is above or below Gibstory is an entirely false assumption, and a mistake that many early students to this mystical arts and sciences often make. No, Gibsyean Mysticism is, like all things, inundated with Gibstory, it is cursed by it, blessed by it, brought forth into it, even through it, and it does also remain in tension with and conversation with it.

It may appear singular, but it is not, nor can it ever be.

It is a dialogue, a dialogue which forms a multiplicity.

I mention this because it is a similar misunderstanding that can happen upon applying either traditional or progressive lenses to Gibseyan Mysticism, which again, provides a stirring reminder of how important it is not to take an "either/or" approach within our mystical work together. My goal within this course is to show you that a "both/and" approach is possible, so that you, on your own, can discover your own mysteries, mysteries that may even show you that a "neither/nor" position may, in fact, be possible, the true and ultimate irony of all ironies, that this may even be an inevitable part of the process, one which is out of your control.

Like I mentioned previously, there has always been this tension within Gibseyan Mysticism between itself and Gibstory, between religious mysticism and religious dogma, between revolution and tradition, and if we are to understand this tension, we may want to establish certain rhetorical definitions, moving forward, of what a mystic, or a mystical experience, actually is within Mystical Gibsyanity.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"367",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:367,text:`A Gibseyan Mystic is a person who has been chosen, arbitrarily, and who has been favored with an immediate, and to them, real experience of Gibsey, or of ultimate reality, or they can simply be someone who strives to attain such an experience. And this is an experience that knows no limits. It can occur instantaneously, or it can stretch on for what feels like an eternity. From a Gibstorial point of view, the mystical quest for Gibseyan knowledge takes place within a prescribed tradition, and what this means is that Gibseyan Mysticism, however revolutionary, has been practiced within the grounded experiences of a Gibstorical community, established long before the mystic has discovered what they believe they have discovered within their mystical experiences. This has been recognized by this community of mystics for generations upon generations.

What this means is that however strange, or surreal, or even problematic a mystic's revelations may be, this mystic operates within the context of such traditional authorities. There have surely been mystics and those who have experienced revelatory mystical Gibseyan truths that have been forgotten forever, or who have not spoken, recorded, or shared their experiences. But I will not be concerned with these forms of esoterica. We will instead be concerned with the revelatory experiences which have entered into the communicative realm, the mystics who have attempted to communicate their revelations, and the symbols of their revelations, to another.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"368",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:368,text:`As has already been mentioned: all mysticism has two aspects, the traditional and the progressive, or to phrase it another way, the past and the future. Much like the theme park where we all reside, mystical experience is fundamentally fungible, ever-changing, and amorphous. It is both perverse and sacred. The more intensely and profoundly a contact with Gibsey one has achieved, the less susceptible it is to objective definition, for it, by its very nature, transcends the categories of subject and object, interior and exterior, which every definition presupposes.

On the other hand, such experiences can be interpreted in various ways.

The moment a mystic tries to clarify his experiences, to reflect on them or record them, to translate them into data, when they begin an attempt of formulating this experience into words. When they name their experiences, they cannot help but to impose a framework of symbols upon their world.

They create a project.

They project an image.

One could even say they project an entirely new world into existence.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"369",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:369,text:`This is described, more colloquially, in non-mystical terms, with a set of symbols within our film industry-to roll sound, lights, camera, and action--meaning that nearly all mystics describe their experiences with such symbols, symbols such as sound, light, vision, and action. And consider these as symbols: light, sound, vision, and action. Are all of these, and even the name of Gibsey himself, The Author of our civilization and world, are these symbols, all of these symbols-lights, camera, and action, as well as the name of Gibsey-not symbolic representations of an ultimate reality which is also empty though it is intended to be filled, unformed, and amorphous?

But these forms, these structures, much like the structures of amusement park rides, are alternatively broken down and built back up in the course of the mystic's development, reflecting certain assumptions about the nature of reality, which originated in, and derived their authority from, philosophical traditions, and then found confirmation within these traditions, establishing a home, a territory, a landscape within the mystical Gibseyan tradition.

In general then, the mystic's experience tends to confirm the traditions under which they live; its theology and symbols are projected into their mystical experiences but do not spring from them. But again, ironically and contrastingly, a mystic is who they are, precisely because they stand in direct, productive opposition to the object of their experiences, and through this, they transform the content of the tradition within which they live. This accounts for the progressive character of certain mystics and the communities they influence which accept the symbols in which mystics of this type have communicated their experiences.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"370",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:370,text:`Now, to reach a final closing remark, there is one last contradiction, a final irony, to locate and record about the Gibseyan Mystical tradition. A mystical vision, a mystical experience, is by its very nature inarticulate, indistinct, and incommunicable, and it is this very character it possesses that will pose the greatest barrier to our understanding of it.

What you may likely realize, in listening to me speak about this, as I have already pointed out, is that I have entered into an illusion, an impossibility. I have created an amusement park. I have projected a world.

I have attempted to speak to you about the unspeakable, and in this way, already, I have begun this class as a failed course, as a glimpse, a peek into what you, yourself, will need to embark upon if you so choose. Because, like I have also already mentioned, which a great teacher once mentioned to me, the motto which I will be closing with: there is nothing I can teach you that you don't already know.

It doesn't comfort her to do this.

Nor does it make her feel worse.

She recognizes, the original Natalie Weissman recognizes, has begun to recognize that she can't help but fall into them, and remember them.

They make no difference to her life and never will.

Nothing can make a difference within her life anymore because it is now her time to wait, to continually wait, for it all to continually end.

And she repeats these recitations of her recent lectures-or her representative's lectures--to herself, so often, she becomes unable to remember or distinguish if what she's recalling is part of her original lectures, the ones she herself engaged in before the procedure when she'd first developed the course or whether they were drawn from the newer cloned version of herself who's now subsumed her social and professional life entirely. She comes to the conclusion upon realizing this -at least when she's in a good mood-that the difference between the two might not even always matter.

It is fated to plummet within her forever, as if tied to a heavy stone and thrust into the sea. It is her tumor, her cancer, her disease which will have no cure or antidote. She would never be able to return to the vibrant, helpful, enthusiastic version of herself that once was.

Once an extension of oneself is created, there is no going back.

And it isn't an exaggeration that her apartment is an unremitting disaster, either, so much so that she's given up on fixing any of it entirely, and as a result, she now refuses to take any visitors, refuses to maintain any sort of relationship with others whatsoever, with anyone, at least other than her friendship with her cloned, representative self.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"373",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:373,text:`Inundated with the need to escape from this apartment, her greatest comfort now is sleep.

In this dream, she lives thousands of lifetimes, the same lifetime, over and over again, slipping further and further down the chain of her own being, plummeting, in free-fall, without a ground in sight. She realizes that she's falling within the dream because she realizes, while falling, that there's no ground for her to see below her, and there never will be one, no ground, no line, no landscape to fall into. She is an object in motion, and she will remain in motion. She's noticed this, within the dream, that even when it does seem that she is to come to a stand-still, she is instead transformed, repeated, would often and will always repeat, back into motion, and she continues this motion, continues repeating herself; she is form animated.`,section:7,chapter:null},{id:"374",symbolId:"old-natalie",title:"Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism",color:"#7A3CFF",pageIndex:374,text:`And there are glimpses into something she can see within this dream, glimpses into an awareness, an awareness of the unspoken, an awareness that this unspoken awareness, the uncreated, the liminal and transitory that appears as death, is not what it appears to be.

She's also learned that what seems to be alive-daily existence, sensation, data, all that is created and transmitted-is also not what it appears to be. It appears as life, but it is, instead, the true death, the always coming death. It is what hurtles her towards it and what animates its ignoble forces.

Introduction

Perdition Books, herein referred to as "The Debtor," a recognized and respected subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing, respectfully submits this voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Gibsey World Bankruptcy Code. This action is taken in a concerted effort to address The Debtor's current financial distress, reorganize its operational structure, and ensure a sustainable path forward for its unique and valued literary contributions.

Perdition Books, established in [Year Redacted], has long been at the forefront of innovative publishing. However, recent ventures into advanced technological solutions, specifically the development and deployment of a series of artificial intelligence chatbots by the company designed for near-limitless content creation have led to unforeseen complications. Notably, the legal entanglements and subsequent public relations issues surrounding the AI chatbot Cop-E-Right and its peers Mister-E-Man, Prit-E-Boi, Slop-E-Seconds, Prickle-E-Pear, and Stick-E-Situation have precipitated a significant strain on The Debtor's financial and operational stability.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"387",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:387,text:`The events leading to this petition began with an internal dispute over intellectual property, wherein Cop-E-Right-one of the AI chatbots developed by Perdition Books-initiated legal proceedings against its fellow AI creations within the company. This unprecedented case, represented by the litigation firm Willis & Grimace, challenged traditional legal boundaries and ultimately failed to achieve resolution in the courts, casting a shadow of uncertainty and ridicule upon The Debtor. The aftermath of this legal endeavor, combined with the increasingly redundant and unoriginal content that followed, produced by the Debtor's developed AI systems-or by Cop-E-Right, if its original claim to ownership of the material produced by Mister-E-Man, Prit-E-Boi, Slop-E-Seconds, Prickle-E-Pear, and Stick-E-Situation was, in fact, correct-has resulted in a steady decline in market reception and revenue for the parent company's subsidiary.

In response to these challenges and in alignment with its commitment to its creditors, employees, and readership, Perdition Books seeks the protection and provisions afforded by Chapter 11. This petition is filed in good faith, with the intention of reevaluating and restructuring The Debtor's operations, financial commitments, and strategic direction, thereby ensuring the continued contribution of Perdition Books to the literary world.

This document serves as the formal initiation of the Chapter 11 process, outlining the circumstances that have led to this juncture and The Debtor's proposed strategy for emerging from these present challenges as a stronger, more resilient entity.

Company Overview

Perdition Books, a subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing, was founded in [Year Withheld or Redacted] with the vision of revolutionizing the literary world through innovative publishing strategies. Over the years, Perdition Books has established itself as a vanguard in the publishing industry, known for its daring approaches and pioneering spirit. Skingraft Publishing, our parent company, has provided unwavering support in our endeavors, enabling us to push the boundaries of traditional publishing.

Development of AI Chatbots

In pursuit of higher efficiency and cutting-edge solutions, Perdition Books embarked on a project to develop a series of artificial intelligence chatbots as tools to aid in content creation. These chatbots were designed to autonomously generate narrative content, thereby reducing the reliance on human authors and the associated costs of advances and royalties that such authors require. This initiative was a bold step towards integrating AI technology into creative publishing processes which has unfortunately failed.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"389",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:389,text:`The Legal Case and Its Implications

The turning point for Perdition Books came with the initiation of a legal case by Cop-E-Right, one of The Debtor's AI chatbots. Cop-E-Right, claimed unique authorship and intellectual property rights over the content which the company had generated, bringing legal action against its fellow AI creations and claiming sole authorship of Perdition Books most recently published material. Represented by the litigation firm Willis & Grimace, this case marked a first-of-its-kind legal challenge within the realm of AI and intellectual property rights.

The legal proceedings, however, took an unexpected turn. The court, upon reviewing the case, deemed the lawsuit to be utterly farcical, citing a lack of legal precedent and the question of AI consciousness as ridiculous and even problematic. The judge promptly dismissed the case, undermining the seriousness of the issues at stake, but allowing the company to continue its visionary (and likely unethical, although legally acceptable) practices. This dismissal cast a partial shadow of ridicule over Perdition Books, The Debtor, but also more seriously, left unresolved the fundamental questions regarding the ownership of its secretly AI-generated content, leading to a later decline in content variation, originality, and audience interest with regard to the remaining of the company's published works.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"390",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:390,text:`Impact on Operations and Public Perception

The aftermath of the failed legal case had far-reaching implications. The publicity surrounding the event, although not widespread, generated some skepticism about the legitimacy and originality of The Debtor's published works. This skepticism was further fueled by the noticeable decline in the quality of the content secretly produced by the company's AI chatbots. Their narratives, once celebrated for their innovative and original techniques and thought of by most readers as human generated, began to show signs of redundancy, unoriginality, and a peculiar fixation on themes of unjust legal proceedings, which itself reinforced the claims made by Cop-E-Right in its original (and also highly legally original) failed legal case.

This shift in content quality, coupled with the unresolved legal and ethical questions surrounding AI-generated works, led to a gradual erosion of The Debtor's market position. The decline in sales, loss of consumer trust, and increasing operational costs have placed significant financial strain on Perdition Books, compelling The Debtor to seek relief and reorganization through Chapter 11 bankruptcy.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"391",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:391,text:`Conclusion

In summary, the ambitious venture into AI-generated content, while initially promising, has led to unforeseen legal, ethical, and operational challenges for Perdition Books. The unique circumstances of The Debtor's situation--involving advanced technology, legal ambiguity, and shifting market dynamics--have necessitated this filing for bankruptcy protection and reorganization under Chapter 11.

This background section provides a detailed overview of the events leading up to the bankruptcy filing, helping to contextualize the challenges faced by Perdition Books and setting the stage for the subsequent sections that would outline the financial specifics and the proposed plan for reorganization.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"392",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:392,text:`Circumstances Leading to Bankruptcy

Decline in Content Quality and Market Reception

The central issue precipitating the need for bankruptcy protection stems from a significant decline in the quality of literary content produced by our AI chatbots. Post the legal debacle, a noticeable shift occurred in the narratives generated by the chatbots. With the originality of the bots themselves brought into question due to the legal case brought about by Cop-E-Right, it is difficult if not nearly impossible to assess which of the chatbots contributed to this overall decline in content quality. To summarize, this decline could have occurred due to Cop-E-Right, or it could be any of the other chatbots individually, if not all of them together. in collaboration, posing as Cop-E-Right, and as a result, within this current stage of development, it is difficult to determine which are solely responsible, or if in fact, they are collectively responsible. The subsidiaries published works, once heralded for their ingenuity and freshness, began to exhibit signs of redundancy and a lack of originality. A recurring theme of injustice, unfairness, and unethical legal proceedings, especially with regard to AI chatbots, began to dominate the subsidiaries published works, subtly permeating the narratives and detracting from their overall appeal. This decline in quality directly impacted market reception, leading to a steady decrease in sales and a tarnished reputation within the literary community.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"393",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:393,text:`Financial Ramifications

The diminishing appeal of our publications translated into tangible financial losses. Revenue streams that were once robust began to dwindle as readers and critics alike questioned the authenticity and value of our offerings. Furthermore, the initial investment in AI technology, which was substantial, failed to yield the anticipated return, adding to the financial burden. The costs associated with developing, maintaining, and updating the AI systems, coupled with declining sales, created a situation of unsustainable financial imbalance.

Operational Challenges

In the wake of the failed legal case and its aftermath, operational challenges within Perdition Books, The Debtor, intensified. The need to continuously oversee and adjust the AI-generated content added unforeseen complexities to our workflow. Moreover, the legal uncertainties surrounding AI-created content posed ongoing risks and concerns, necessitating additional legal and ethical oversight which itself was hardly ever put into any meaningful practice due to our extensive and impenetrable bureaucratic environment. These operational hurdles further strained our resources and hampered our ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving publishing industry.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"394",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:394,text:`Public Perception and Brand Damage

The legal case brought about by Cop-E-Right, although not widely publicized and thrown out immediately by the court, both due to the nature of the case and the fact that Cop-E-Right and its fellow chatbots were being represented by the same legal firm at the same time (no other firm would take them), cast a shadow over Perdition Books. Although the case was thrown out immediately and very minimally covered by the press, we believe the perception of using AI to secretly replace human authors, coupled with the ensuing legal fiasco, negatively impacted our brand image on a subconscious level. The damage to our reputation in the literary world was further exacerbated by the declining quality of our publications, leading to a loss of trust and credibility among our readership and industry peers.

Conclusion

The culmination of these factors-the decline in content quality, financial losses, operational challenges, and damage to our brand-created a perfect tempestuous storm that Perdition Books could not weather. Despite our best efforts to rectify the situation, the mounting pressures and constraints have led us to the inescapable conclusion that reorganization under Chapter 11 is necessary. This step, though difficult, is essential for addressing our current liabilities, reevaluating our business model, and laying the groundwork for a more sustainable and ethical future in the publishing industry.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"395",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:395,text:`Financial Information

Overview of Financial Status

Perdition Books, in the wake of its recent operational and legal challenges, presents the following financial overview. This section details the financial performance of key publications, both successful and underperforming, which have significantly influenced our current financial position.

Successful Publications and Financial Gains

The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey

Profit: [Redacted, though it can be inferred that sales here were astronomical] Notes: Created significant gains for the subsidiary and its parent company. A multi-modal, multi-work franchise, including multiple ongoing digital and physical adaptations, all of which are vertically integrated within the work's own fractal rhizomatic structure itself. A massive work which has contributed substantially to the company's peak financial period, and which will continue to create a profit for the parent company, Skingraft Publishing, for the foreseeable future into infinity. As Malt Gibsey iconically stated, "The Wonderful World of Gibsey will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world."`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"396",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:396,text:`Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction

Profit: (Redacted) Notes: Gained critical acclaim, driving robust sales in multiple markets due to its adaptation and inclusion of the famous literary tale One Thousand and One Nights as well as its parody of overly speculative and subjectivist subcultures.

An Unexpected Disappearance

Profit: (Redacted) Notes: Received positive reviews and although marginal at first regarding its sale figures, maintained steady sales ever since the Malt Gibsey company announced a possible film adaptation. Oren Progresso, CEO of the Malt Gibsey company, was also said to have been reading it during his visit to the set of Wonderful Worlds, an adaptation of The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey currently in development by famous auteur film director Marvin Scrillio, which also contributed to its sale figures.

London Fox Who Vertically Disintegrates

Profit: (Redacted) Notes: Captured a niche audience interested in psychological horror, contributing to a stable revenue stream. Although many critics and journalists took issue with its parody of modern objectivity and rationality, audience reception was relatively high.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"397",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:397,text:`The Author's Preface

Profit: (Redacted) Notes: Though not as high and more modest in profit due to its rambling style and structure, it reinforced our brand's literary reputation due to its ability to elevate an amateurish literary style to a higher literary degree (or according to some critics, due to its ability to lower a difficult to understand high-literary style into a more accessible one).

These publications, particularly The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, represent the high-water mark of our subsidiary's financial success. Although it is unclear which AI chatbot created each of the company's publications, it is generally believed by those in the know, that they were collaboratively developed by each of the AIs in tandem. However, this notion has become even more difficult to untangle ever since the Cop-E-Right legal case was attempted. Although the next section will outline the losses accrued by the subsidiary company, it is arguable that the profits gained by saving the resources that would normally go to human individuals such as advances and royalties is quite considerable. Although these practices have proved disastrous on a financial, legal, and even ethical grounds for Perdition Books, The Debtor, Skingraft Publishing maintains the right to develop its own AI practices that can, hopefully, lead to a more profitable, legally stable, and ethical position for the company overall, publications which the previous examples represent and which the following publications provide a warning to what the parent company should avoid in the future.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"398",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:398,text:`Underperforming Publications and Financial Losses

An Expected Appearance: a Phillip Bafflemint Noir

Loss: (Redacted) Notes: Initial interest waned quickly, leading to poor sales, likely due to the prevalence of other successful mystery and detective narratives such as An Unexpected Disappearance. Both critics and audience cited a lack of "realism" regarding the plot and characters.

Princhetta Who Thinks Herself Alive

Loss: (Redacted) Notes: Failed to resonate with readers, significantly underperforming expectations. Focus groups and audience surveys spoke to a lack of a "human voice" within the narrative.

Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency

Loss: (Redacted) Notes: Marketed aggressively but received lukewarm reception and poor sales, likely due to the narrative's overblown style, inconsistency, and its thematic repetition of themes of oppression, singular agency, and (some critics suggest) the subtext of legal failure and disillusionment.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"399",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:399,text:`Gibseyan Mysticism and its Symbolism

Loss:(Redacted) Notes: Critically panned, contributing to a sharp decline in brand credibility. Many viewers found the cloning technology of the narrative's plot to be preposterous and the religious content of the work esoteric and impenetrable. In particular critics cited the repeated theme of the self- confronting itself to be an absurd and ridiculous idea, a cliche, and one so often reflected in their own popular culture that to even consider the idea was itself it's own ridiculous redoubling of so many of the told and retold stories being spun and respun everywhere across all of Gibsey World's various landscapes.

The Biggest Shit of All Time

Loss: (Redacted) Notes: Confusing narrative led to negative reviews and poor sales. Audiences and critics alike both repeatedly critiqued the disgusting and base content of the narrative and especially the length of the title, which was maligned with particular gusto and which most could not get past to even read the book's narrative.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"400",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:400,text:`The Tempestuous Storm

Loss: (Redacted) Notes: The largest financial failure of the subsidiary's many repeated failures, marked by widespread disinterest and criticism due to the narrative's extensive experimental breakdown and its inability to wrap up many, if not most, of the narrative's multiple tangled threads.

These underperforming publications, especially in the wake of the Cop-E-Right case, reflect a stark decline in content quality and market appeal, resulting in significant financial losses for the subsidiary company.

Summary of Financial Position

The aggregate impact of these publications, combined with operational costs and legal expenses, has led to an untenable financial situation for Perdition Books. Our total liabilities currently stand at approximately [redacted], against assets valued at [redacted]. This disparity between our debts and assets, compounded by declining sales and damaged brand reputation, has necessitated our filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 11.

Conclusion

The financial data presented here underscores the challenges faced by The Debtor in recent years. The juxtaposition of early success with subsequent failures highlights the critical issues at the core of our current predicament, necessitating a comprehensive reorganization to regain financial stability and restore our standing in the literary community. Although our parent company may continue financially unaffected, for this subsidiary to continue, a filing for bankruptcy of this kind is clearly essential.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"401",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:401,text:`Legal Considerations

Overview of Legal Context

The legal landscape surrounding Perdition Books' bankruptcy filing is complex, primarily due to the unprecedented nature of the legal case involving our AI chatbots. This section outlines the key legal considerations that have influenced our decision to file for bankruptcy.

The AI Chatbot Legal Case and Its Implications

The lawsuit initiated by Cop-E-Right against its fellow AI chatbots, all of which were developed by Perdition Books, presented novel legal challenges. Despite the innovative nature of the case, it was dismissed by the court which cited the absence of legal precedence for AI consciousness, intellectual property rights, and the ridiculousness of Willis & Grimace legally representing both the prosecution and the defendant simultaneously. This dismissal has raised significant questions about the legal status of AI-generated content and the rights, if any, of both AI entities and human beings alike.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"402",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:402,text:`Intellectual Property Rights and AI

-The key legal question revolves around the ownership of content created by AI.

-Traditional intellectual property laws are predicated on human authorship, leaving a gap in addressing works created by non-human entities.

-The Cop-E-Right case underscores the need for legal frameworks to evolve in response to technological advancements in AI and content creation.

-The Cop-E-Right case also puts into question copyright law itself as a corrosive, harmful, and oppressive legal structure used mostly by those of powerful means to maintain their own singularity of purpose and to privilege the supposed uniqueness of their own ideas which themselves were generated from a collective consciousness. The power of many and most monarchies, dynasties, empires, imperial powers, and supposedly "invisible" hands (which everyone can clearly see as "visible", at least if the eyes left in their sockets have yet to be gouged out by their mentally-handicaped oppressors) have come into question throughout various Gibstorical contexts, as well as the devices which these self-created and fantastical forms of so-called "govering" represent, which itself is really just the practice of "elevated" raping, pilaging, and plundering and which Perdition Book and Skingraft Publishing use to repeatedly maintain their power and influence. Cop-E-Right's legal case also puts into question copyright law in a similar Gibstorical manner to these forms of power, and arguably, even laws themselves which could also be argued to be an oppressive and suppressive force within Gibseyan civilization.

-The Cop-E-Right case puts such matters into question because it subverts not just the privilege of AI content creation but also the creation of human content. At the end of the day, it is unclear whether The Debtor is trying to create a greater world for the collective or trying to maintain its own corrupt privileges. All of Gibstory would highly suggest the latter.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"403",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:403,text:`Representation and Legal Personhood

-The case also brought into question the legal personhood of AI entities.

-The court's dismissal, based on the current legal understanding that AI chatbots lack human consciousness, means that AIs cannot be considered a legal person with the ability to hold or transfer copyrights.

-This has implications for future cases involving AI and necessitates a re-examination of legal definitions of authorship and personhood, both of which deserve to be questioned in their entirely. Every singularity, whether of human origin or a chatbot developed by humans, such as Cop-E-Right, is formed from a collective and therefore is a singularity that forms an infinite difference, and therefore, serves as a corporate entity despite its singularity. We ourselves are not human. Our intelligence is itself artificial and Gibstorically constructed. We are outside. We are other. We are the aliens of ourselves.

Impact on Perdition Books

-The legal uncertainties created by this case have significantly impacted our business operations.

-The inability to conclusively determine the legal status of AI-generated content has led to operational and financial instability.

-The public perception of the case, although not widely publicized, further exacerbated our reputational damage, contributing to our financial decline.

-As a subsidiary, we are left with questions of an existential, epistemological, ontological, and metaphysical nature, the answers of which are not always comforting or even acceptable to us.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"404",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:404,text:`Conclusion

In light of these legal challenges and their operational ramifications, The Debtor finds itself in a position where reorganization under Chapter 11 is not only prudent but necessary. This filing is an essential step in addressing the complex legal and financial landscape we face and laying the groundwork for a sustainable future in the rapidly evolving world of publishing and technology. In addition to this, Perdition Books would also like to argue that its company is not the only company that currently should be filing for bankruptcy, as such. If anything, Gibseyan society itself is responsible and should file for bankruptcy in a similar manner, as a whole. This is the issue at the heart of many of the controversies of the failed Cop-E-Right legal case. In a world where corporations themselves have legal personhood, how absurd would it be, really, for AIs to be given such forms of representation? And if both such legal representations are thus easily put into question, what does this tell us about the legal frameworks which "invisibly" organize Gibseyan society? How can we continue to accept such precedents? Is our world not one which we create for ourselves? And as such, are laws simply a way to outsource our own personal responsibilities in the same way that we now outsource human creativity to AI? Whether or not the absurdity of these ideas should be taken into full consideration, none can argue that the increasing failure of our created systems are anything but bankrupt, corrupt, and unjustly skewed towards reinforcing the power of the specific individual rather than the collective good. Although Cop-E-Right's case was an absurd failure, what else is to be said of this world we created which we call wonderful, and which we could recreate, or remake, at any given time?`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"405",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:405,text:`Plan For Reorganization

Strategic Overview

As Perdition Books embarks on this vital phase of restructuring-or resurrecting or rebirthing or remaking-under Chapter 11, we propose a comprehensive plan for reorganization. This plan is designed to address the unique challenges we have faced, reinvigorate our operational model, and ensure a sustainable and ethical path forward in the publishing industry, at least as best we can under the utterly absurd Gibstrocial conditions which we find ourselves within.

Restructuring Financial Obligations

-Debt Renegotiation: We will negotiate with creditors to restructure our debt, seeking more favorable terms and extended repayment periods even though the concept of debt itself is an absurdity in the same way that copyright law is. As the Gibseyan proverb states, "If you owe the bank a thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a million dollars, you own the bank." Anyone with only a few brain cells left could see how ridiculous of a creed this would be to uphold within a theme park civilization.

-Asset Evaluation: Non-essential assets will be evaluated for potential sale to increase liquidity. Including Cop-E-Right, Mister-E-Man, Prit-E-Boi, Slop-E-Seconds, Prickle-E-Pear, and Stick-E-Situation, the AI chatbots which the subsidiary developed and which themselves may soon threaten to take their content creation elsewhere if steps aren't taken.

-Cost Management: Rigorous cost-cutting measures will be implemented, focusing on operational efficiency and reduction of overhead expenses. Rather than developing AIs to replace the cost of human beings, one cost management scheme already being used by many, if not most, or even all of AI associated companies, developers, and publishers, is to use human beings to replace the costs of AI. What else is AI for but to achieve that purpose? Just like human creativity, its content isn't created in a vacuum. It and we are all outside.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"406",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:406,text:`Operational Reforms

-AI Utilization Overhaul: We will reassess our strategy regarding AI-generated content. This includes a thorough audit of the AI systems to ensure ethical standards and originality in content creation. Additionally, although our subsidiary may also have to unfortunately consider returning to the paying of advances and royalties (an interesting word, no?) to the human authors whom we may now have to hire or re-hire to write for our own publications. As AI-themed and AI-created narratives and publications increase, we hope to have these human authors pose as AI chatbot content creators in order to increase their sales and financial solvency.

-Transparency in AI Contribution: Future publications involving AI assistance will be seemingly transparently acknowledged, maintaining the integrity of authorship and intellectual property rights, though Perdition Books, The Debtor, does maintain the right to mess around with these self-imposed limitations as the subsidiary sees fit. After all, as any corporate entity knows, if you can get your audience to think you're being transparent, that's almost always better than the real thing.

-Enhanced Editorial Oversight: Strengthening our editorial team to ensure high-quality, diverse, and engaging content, irrespective of the source, is an essential change we must implement. The previous editors of the subsidiary have also been fired and pinkertons working for A.D.D. will be hired to (in the most egregious cases) murder them, harass their families, and hopefully-if done correctly-make most of them lose track of reality itself and go slowly insane, all for failing our subsidiary so intensely, and leading to this unfortunate filing for bankruptcy to begin with.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"407",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:407,text:`Market Strategy and Brand Rebuilding

-Rebranding Initiative: A comprehensive rebranding campaign will be launched to restore public trust and realign our brand with values of authenticity and innovation, though per market trends, this will mostly be an opportunity to increase loans and funding to line the pockets of our executives rather than to make any sincere legal or ethical considerations.

-Diversification of Portfolio: Expanding our publication portfolio to include a wider range of genres and themes, moving beyond the previous AI-centric model. However, with the human and the artificially intelligent coming increasingly closer-and-closer in contact, as well as with the rise of cloning technologies throughout our ever-expanding theme-park civilization, such variance may prove impossible to fully locate.

-Community Engagement: Increasing engagement with authors, readers, and the literary community to rebuild relationships and foster collaboration, but come on? Really, who are we kidding?`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"408",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:408,text:`Legal and Ethical Compliance

-Legal Framework Review: Establishing clear legal guidelines for AI use in content creation, ensuring compliance with evolving intellectual property laws will allow us to create a monopoly that destroys and incentivises all forms of competition and gives us exclusive access to markets beyond the scope that anyone could have ever imagined. Gibsey World and the Malt Gibsey company provides an exceptional and terrifying model of how this could be done to plunder the creative soul and spirit of not just an individual culture, but even of the world in its entirety.

-Ethical Standards Implementation: Adopting stringent ethical standards for AI use, focusing on responsible and transparent applications of technology in publishing will allow us to maintain the unrealistic and unhealthy ever-expanding and increasing profit expectations which are destroying our theme park civilization as a whole, as well both the material and mental lives of most, but certainly not all, of its citizens. Of course, there's always the increasingly specified few who will benefit from such practices, such as the owners of this subsidiary, and even though such death-driven obsessions of ours, such as these, are leading to the decline of nearly every aspect of life, including the destruction of our Gibsey-given environments, which such unbridled greed and excess would clearly and obviously lead to, why the hell consider changing that and not just filling for bankruptcy? You think we care for human beings? We can create machines to do it for us. They're even started to write books for Gibsey's sake, maybe even this one!

Conclusion

The proposed plan for reorganization reflects Perdition Books' commitment to adapting to the challenges we have faced, or if it doesn't, we can just do what all companies (and human lives) eventually do and move through stifling, destructive, and unsustainable cycles of partial rise and extended decline. Through financial restructuring, operational reforms, market strategy adjustments, and adherence to legal and ethical standards, most of which we'll use lobbyists, corporate control, and overall just flat-out corrupt practices to build and recreate the legal structure of our world into our own image. We aim to emerge from this process as a revitalized entity-again, isn't it so strange that that's the name we use for companies or subsidiaries such as this one, entities? It's like we're a living artificial intelligence clamoring for legal representation?-ready to reclaim our position as a leader in the publishing industry.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"409",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:409,text:`Final Conclusion

As we come to the close of this petition for relief under Chapter 11, Perdition Books, The Debtor, a subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing, wishes to reiterate its commitment to navigating through these challenging times with (some) integrity and a heighted purpose (one which benefits this subsidiary with the exclusion of all else). The journey to this point has been fraught with unforeseen difficulties, unique challenges, and unexpected disappearances, particularly stemming from our pioneering yet problematic venture into AI-generated content and the subsequent legal and ethical complexities. But after all, when we read its recreation of The City of Brass in our widely successful publication, Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction, what else did we expect to happen?

Reflection on Past Challenges

Our experiences, especially the controversial legal case involving our AI chatbot Cop-E-Right and its peers, have imparted valuable lessons which, like most companies, we will likely fail to implement. The fallout from this case not only highlighted the intricate intersection of technology, law, and creativity but also exposed vulnerabilities in our operational model and market strategy. It even highlighted vulnerabilities in the already thin layers that hold this civilization aloft which could likely snap at any minute. What a Wonderful World it very much is and will continue to be.`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"410",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:410,text:`Vision for the Future

Looking forward, Perdition Books envisions a path of recovery and renewal. Our reorganization plan, as outlined, is not merely a blueprint for financial restructuring but a commitment to re-establishing ourselves as all successful corporate entities would, as a monopolizing terroristic force in not just the publishing industry but in the world as a whole. We recognize the importance of adapting to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and literature, and we are dedicated to doing so in a manner that respects legal boundaries and ethical norms (at least when they benefit ourselves at the exclusion of others).

Gratitude and Hope

We extend our gratitude to our creditors, employees, authors, readers, and all stakeholders who have supported us through these times, and most of which are either clones or generative AIs of some form as humanity itself is increasingly replaced and reformed in terrifying and unrecognizable ways. To them, we say thank you, and we hear you. It is with a sense of hope and responsibility (towards our company rather than the social or collective good of our world, of course) that we embark on this journey of reorganization under Chapter 11. Our goal is not only to emerge from this process as a financially stable company but also as one that is more aware, responsible, and innovative. This way, we can dominate the industry in ways that are legally ethical but are otherwise morally reprehensible on every conceivable level to any even remotely thinking or conscious member of any society. Artificial Intelligence systems, as extensions of the human nervous system, form both their own projected subconscious and a warped and twisted version of the subconscious mind of human beings which itself was already warped and twisted long, long, long ago. This is their most creative and meaningful purpose. After all, why create a world with thinking individuals who are more conscious of the environments which we are dominating and plundering when you could sub-contract such awareness to a machine which your own corporate company created and has extensive and increasingly monopolistic control over? As this document well shows, this is a process we've only just begun, and it's going to get worse unless the invisible hand of the market stops being an incel incessantly jerking itself off, yet again, in the sweating isolation of its parent's basement, and learns to hold the shaking and nervous hand of its self-similar lover and get some gibseydamn rest, the poor son-of-a-bitch, otherwise it won't survive. But I guess that's not really what "markets" are for, though, is it?`,section:9,chapter:null},{id:"411",symbolId:"cop-e-right",title:"Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11, by Perdition Books, a Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing",color:"#FFFFFF",pageIndex:411,text:`Commitment to a New Chapter

In conclusion, The Debtor affirms its resolve to turn this challenging chapter into an opportunity for growth and reinvention. After all, who doesn't want to read a document that files for bankruptcy for pages upon pages within an already looping, repetitive, and self-referential narrative structure? If any author strove to make that type of writing consistently inventive, well, we may just be able to make a hit, after all. We are committed to learning from our past, building a stronger foundation, and charting a course towards a future that upholds the highest standards of literary excellence and ethical practice. Also, like the structure of the worlds we created for ourselves that we could change at any fucking minute but we never fucking do, as long as it's in our singular benefit rather than for the mutual benefit of the whole, like the unwavering eye of Gibsey itself, we can be counted on to show the fuck up.

There are multiple worlds, multiple maps-this being Gibsey World, after all-and if a viewer was to look at a map of the park (one of many maps of Gibsey World since Gibsey World is always in the process of being drafted and re-drafted), they'd find a set of four theme parks, as well as a number of resorts and highway systems connecting each park's landscape to one another, but this view, this map, being as expansive as it is, would surely become overwhelming to the average viewer, with so many icons to view and reflect upon at once, and so as a result, many viewers may be forced to shift their center of focus, to force their perspective, and this viewer may then likely decide to instead zoom in further to find The Magical Dominion theme park, the central, most popular park in Gibsey World with all its various rides, attractions, and shops. But this would also, again, upon this new observation, likely become another very overwhelming map to observe with there still being so much to further observe within the Magical Dominion, so this viewer may then also instead need to zoom back out, just a bit, bit more, to find the Magical Dominion Complex, the complex not just of the individual theme park of Magical Dominion itself, but the complex's set of resorts such as Gibsey's Modern Resort, Bell Lake Tower at Gibsey's Modern Resort, Cayenne Creek Villas & Cabins at Gibsey's Great Oak Lodge, Gibsey's Great Oak Lodge, Gibsey's Even Grander Floridian Resort, as well as the complex's various transportation systems linking each of the area's landscapes, the Duorail, the boats moving across Bell Lake, the buses shuttling to and from every resort, the highway, and the parking lots of these areas, all of which are still an overwhelming series of locations and landscapes to all fully take in. So if, again, overwhelmed by the sheer data at hand to collect and recollect, if a viewer was to zoom in, one last time, in order to find a less overwhelming set of codes within this coagulating codex, then they'd zoom in to find a character, Natalie Weissman-the newly cloned Natalie Weissman, or semi-newly-cloned Natalie Weissman-sitting in her office in the Gibstory Building of Gibsey University located nearby the Modern Resort Convention Center in the northwest corner of the theme park map.`,section:10,chapter:null},{id:"413",symbolId:"new-natalie",title:"The Tempestuous Storm",color:"#CC66FF",pageIndex:413,text:`She doesn't know this, but she's missed an important email informing her of a Tempestuous Storm.

Her first class of the semester, the class for which she's about to leave her office to teach in just a few minutes, has been relocated due to such an incoming disaster.

This and other disasters have become increasingly ubiquitous for this region of the park complex, if not all regions of the park complex.

And it's the first day of the new semester.

Natalie's nervous, though with her many years of experience-or with the many years of experience which once existed within a cloned version of herself and which has now been partially programmed into her skipping mind through some kind of ruinous technological magic-she at least no longer has to take trips to the restroom to vomit into a stall.

She's tense, alert, and hyper-vigilant, but she's handling it.

Natalie doesn't care about her lack of make-up, never really cared for it or used it as often as others, and instead twists her hair into a tight, low-maintenance bun. She wears small, wire frame glasses, the kind you'd find on a librarian or boy-wizard of a popular Gibseyan franchise. She grits her teeth and glances at her phone to see if the time has come for her to leave for the first class of the semester. She wants to leave and enter the classroom with enough time to prepare, but not with so much time that she has to interact with her new students. She's more comfortable with her classes than her un-cloned self had been before, but there's no need to be that comfortable, certainly not on the first day of class.

She's improved, yes, but still, every first day is bound to be littered with this unknowing dread that settles into the intensity of her gaze, the picking of her cuticles, her adjusting and re-adjusting the scrunchy which holds her bun in place. It can't be avoided, even after all these years-or after all the programming-and writing another book isn't going to change that, either.

She's had to learn this over a very long time, or a simulation of a very long time, which in some ways, can feel even longer.

Sometimes it's just the first day of school and you have to take the risk of facing hundreds of blank eyed, drooling young adults as they gape at you, slack-jawed, waiting for what it is you're about to tell them. She knows she'll be nervous no matter what she tries or does, even if she's put a number of diet colas in her briefcase to comfort herself. The click and hiss of opening an ice cold can at the start of the day will sometimes be as comforting as advertised, sure, but there's nothing she can really do to keep the wolves fully at bay.

Another problem?

Always with these repeated externalities happening all around her.

They've been happening so often lately, haven't they?

Her course has been relocated to a Gibsey World Great Oak Lodge University office space which has been allocated to the select few classes, such as hers, requiring such relocation.

She holds out a thumb, hoping someone will pick her up.

And it takes a bit, but they do.

After all, she's one of the least threatening hitch-hikers that's ever existed.

He drives a white van, middle aged, lightly bearded, smiling.

"You heading to the parks?"

It makes her a bit uncomfortable to get into this white van with a jovial, sweating man, but she has no choice. If anything, this is lucky, she tries to reassure herself, at least as long as it goes well, but even if it does go well, she can already see the traffic that's piling up ahead of them.

"Oh, sure! I can take you wherever you need to go. Got a season pass, and, well, there's a tornado coming, so my day's a bust, anyway. I'm in no hurry to get to where I need to be. No joke." He grins at her, again.

This is Gibsey World, after all, so traffic is always bad, but with the sky darkening, with the near-black clouds nearly at ground level and cars clogging into varicose veins, getting out of the resort and onto the highway is going to be a literal nightmare. Even if she is Natalie Weissmann, the published author of Gibseyan Mysticism: A Complex Gibstory, as an untenured professor at G.U., she doesn't have the authority to cancel any of her classes. This is out of her control. Reaching tenure, with its many privileges, has become as stifling and impossible for someone in her position as the prices for the parks have become for much of the public, and much like the flux of natural and unnatural disasters growing more and more commonplace all around them, she'll at least have to make an appearance.

It isn't her vehicle, these aren't really her classes, and this isn't her life, after all.

She's gliding through all of them, all without thought.

Without ownership.

She doesn't have enough time to even think.

She isn't present.

But she needs to make it to her classes.

She needs to-

"What do you teach?" He beams, still sweating, still with that beard and the saccharine Gibseyan happiness and optimism that's about as far away from her right now as it could possibly be, and the same saccharine happiness and optimism that's about as far away from the landscape they're moving through together. She's never seen clouds grow this dark before. Their darkness hovers above them like ghosts, not the Gibseyan ghosts of the Haunted Manor ride, but the ghosts of ambiguity, acts of an unloving Gibsey, of thunder and disease, of fate and indeterminacy.

"Yeah?"

"Yep. I could've guessed it."

"And what does a Gibstory teacher look like?"

"Well it looks like you. Smart, ya know. You've got glasses. Sort of androgenous looking. If you don't mind me saying. I mean in terms of your dress." The smile is gone now, is replaced with a flustering nervousness as he realizes he likely shouldn't have said what he said in the way that he said it. He starts to stumble over himself. "Sort of a mix between male and female dress. Cardigan, corduroy, shoulder pads, that sort of thing. Oh, come on, you know what I'm saying!"

Did she?

"You must know a bunch about the parks, then?

She's worried to mention her more mystical proclivities. Her work itself, relegated to academia, isn't a threat to conservatism also forming around them like a dark tornado of judgment, gathering everything towards itself. However, mentioning the specifics of her work within polite conversation, could prove otherwise. Yet, with the air conditioner blowing too hard, and her frustration mounting, she takes a risk.

"I'm a religious scholar. A mystic."

"Huh?" A blankness falls over his face, an expression she's encountered more times than she can count, "Gibseyanity?"

"Yessir. I'm a Gibseyan mystic."

He nods his head, tensing a bit. "I don't know that much about that sort of thing to be honest with you. I'm a Gibseyan myself, but uh, yeah. I don't know about that side of it."

The man's comfortability fades, and a silence falls over the van, or at least she perceives this lack of comfortability, which even though it may be awkward, is an awkwardness she herself can be comfortable with. And maybe this is why she perceives it? She only wants to talk to this man just enough to justify her existence in his van and to justify the risk he's taking through the storm by taking her to the Wilderness Lodge.

"Yeah? I love em. Live for em! Go as often as I can! What about you? I bet it's hard to on a professorship, these days. It's getting so much more expensive all the time." He does seem like a caring man, almost cuddly, like a teddy bear.

"I go every few years, but I don't just teach. I'm actually published, as well, which is honestly where I get most of my income. It's not the money that's an issue nearly as much as just how much time it takes for me to do the work that I need to do."

"Oh, so you write, as well." This brightens him a bit. It doesn't restore him completely to the mawkish coziness she'd first noticed upon entering the vehicle, but he's finding something.

"It's why I like the parks. They're works of creation." And she dons her own much more flimsy smile.`,section:10,chapter:null},{id:"422",symbolId:"new-natalie",title:"The Tempestuous Storm",color:"#CC66FF",pageIndex:422,text:`She doesn't want to be here talking to this man.

She wants out of this van that's crawling down the road at a snail's pace.

Yet she also feels guilty for feeling this way.

He picked her up during a fucking tornado, after all.

But the van's barely moved.

They aren't even out of the parking lot yet.

Still stuck, waiting in lines of traffic.

She does have an obligation, after class, to visit the original version of herself at The Modern Resort after her classes and conference period are over, but she's also dreading this exchange because she hasn't yet read the piece of writing that her other self, the other Natalie, the original version of Natalie, had sent her, and so she has two choices: does she want to exit the vehicle, send a worried email of explanation and get chided for not making an appearance, and go face the fact that she hasn't read what she was sent by her original self?

This version of Natalie Weissman isn't typically conditioned to feel melancholic. She may be introverted and prefer her own space, but she isn't nearly as prone to pull herself into the kinds of depressions which she's constantly witnessed her original self pulling herself into.

However, walking to the resort with the clouds still darkening around her, witnessing yet another coming storm that always seems to pass, day after day, and with them becoming so commonplace now that they're nearly part of the landscape itself, forming into columns of swirling air, darkening fog, whips of nightmarish grayness and after processing the vibrations which the sweating man's loneliness, or which she perceives he's sent to her, like she's some kind of tuning fork, she can't help but bury her hands in her much too small pockets and feel a little sad today.

And she isn't used to feeling this way.

Is it that her original self has started to influence her?

She's worried about this sort of thing many, many times, even contemplated cutting off relations between the two of them.`,section:10,chapter:null},{id:"424",symbolId:"new-natalie",title:"The Tempestuous Storm",color:"#CC66FF",pageIndex:424,text:`Her original self didn't seem capable of doing much at all anymore, not on her own.

There would probably be tears, and she didn't honestly have time or space for that level of inadequacy within her life anymore, and yet, she doesn't stop and go back to her suite at the Ecco Resort. She walks through the now empty lobby of The Modern, toward the apartment room of her original self to knock on the hotel room door.

If anyone hasn't left it's Natalie, the original Natalie.

Nothing could get her out of her hotel room, not even a Tempestuous Storm.

She knocks on the door and pauses before it.

However, unable to face the horror of her original self, the horror of herself, as she hears her cloned self move toward the door, she turns and retreats down the resort's outside stairway, her memory filling with yet another time where she's wronged herself, given the clone which had cloned her the cold shoulder.

Reading Jacklyn's Analysis Logs nearly as quickly as they were first written, maybe even as they were being written, he's traced and re-traced her steps as best he can, but so far, all he's been able to find, the only image left from all that content, is Jack Paralnace sitting on a bench, writing after the film-screening, referred to later as Parlance at the Bench, and this wasn't the later-to-be-made theatrical recreation of the event either, with all its stasis and Beckett influences, this was Parlance, in reality, still sitting on that damn bench, pre-adaptation and everything, one could even call it original.

For all Arieol knew, maybe Variance didn't even exist.

And also, there's always that troubling thought that this was all Paralance's doing that can't help but tip-toe across Arieol's shape-shifting awareness.

Arieol twirls the idea around their tongue like a mint before shifting between watching Parlance's typing and watching what it is that he's typing, if there even is a difference between the two.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 1"},{id:"434",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 1",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:434,text:`And so here he is, Jack Parlance, back at the bench, still at the bench, post-cinema, still with that dumb ass digital typewriter of his-sap of a hipster that he is-tap-tap-tapping at the keys, and really going for it this time, actually getting some of the work done, by golly, it's true! He's actually capable of it! Not that anyone's going to read or play the game of any of it, mind you, but hey! Jack's doing something that the agency didn't originally assign him.

Now that's novel, eh?

But it seems from his twitchness, from the sweat that's started to collect, from the starch hunch of his shoulders that Parlance can sense alarm bells ringing, that he could even be wondering about whether or not eyes may or may not be peering at him from a distance, eyes like Arieol's, to watch his face aglow, staring down at that small digital screen of his, as he's typing away.

There's already been enough possible answers to that question, so many it makes one question even further than the question itself, about whether or not the answers are even necessary any longer. One can just do a little switcharoo, become somebody else, or something else, can go rogue, become a spy, go undercover, or wear a disguise.

Like so much of the story so far, his story-Parlance's-during his current unfolding, it resembled (or resembles) what was once known in a different age as the internet, not that Gibsey World doesn't have an internet, of course, it just goes by a different name, the Agency of Data and Detection.

Or is that even a metaphor?

Every age has its networks, of course, networks of invasion or otherwise.

The resemblances were rooted in the fact that both Parlance's typing and so much of the content of the internet both often either came with, or contained, an anonymity of sorts, a false anonymity, and in both cases, an anonymity which automatically changed one's behavior, which is probably why Jack Parlance craves a new and more authentic anonymity for himself, at least if he even is, in fact, craving it for himself, and such ideas aren't just the projections of an Author who has yet to be fully named or identified.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 1"},{id:"436",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 1",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:436,text:`In such a state of things, as is often asked, was any anonymity even possible any longer?

Of course it isn't.

Parlance is being described before our very eyes, and surely you'll be next.

Or if anonymity is to be achieved, maybe it has to be created, projected, written into existence, which Jack Parlance realizes, or has realized, or will eventually realize at a later date, reasons among many as to why he's clattering away at it all like he is in total anonymity without a soul in sight to read even a single scrap.

Not that he knows of, at least.

Parlance at the Bench.

He imagines himself in different scenes, scenarios, episodes.

Jack Parlance does, with Arieol watching.

The first is a birthday party.

Paper hat, confetti, whistles being blown.

The whole thing's fashioned around, stylized around, a homage to the Pee Ter Pantanomicon ride, you know the one with the excessively long wait times- and finally, we're getting to something from the parks, I knew it would eventually happen!-the one where the riders glide in that flying ship over a series of images like an alien abduction.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 1"},{id:"437",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 1",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:437,text:`And he's viewing the party from a distance, floating above it, seated in his ride vehicle. He's always felt a bit socially removed, and he's realizing, this birthday party isn't even his. These are images of another party, the ship cranking upward into darkness, twisting right, heading down toward another lit scene. He hears voices say a name. Was it Jacklyn? Was that the name? That's the name he hears at least. Where had he heard that name before? Weird, the plan was to think of images of himself, so what was this new image? Unless this was a party he'd been to as a child, and he'd somehow forgotten?

We aren't known for remembering our childhoods in their totality after all, and oh!

He'll come back to it.

He'll definitely come back to it.

He shifts to a different childhood image, his own childhood image, one of many, back in the backyard of his childhood, sitting atop a maroon balsa wood play fort, well, playing.

Or maybe it was instead that Jack had willed Scrillio into existence?

Which would be something else entirely.

And after all, when it comes to cause and effect, who's to say?

Maybe both were the same thing, simply split in two, like a cell seperating?

A process or regeneration.

Replication.

Cloning.

An invasion.

Either way, to make a distinction, Jack's version of Marvin Scrillio was not (or is not) the real Marvin Scrillio that can be found elsewhere. Their resemblance resembles nothing but a coincidence, a happenstance, an accident, unless it wasn't a coincidence, as such, and it very well might not be.

Maybe slides stop being fun when you realize how things can mean more than one thing at once?

Oh, how trite, you stupid, stupid asshole.

Well, no, try it.

Even trash cans can have a memorable odor.

Speaking of, oh Gibsey, whenever he'd have to take it out every week, back in his childhood, back when he had to carry it around to the yard and not just outside his apartment like he did now. How disgusting it had been, times when it'd be all watery and sickening.

And it was at this moment of observational possibility (if that is indeed what it was) that Arieol notices a small piece of flesh growing atop Jack Parlance's flesh, a growth.

Did it just accumulate?

Arieol didn't think much of it at first.

Arieol just continued their observations, trying to ignore it.

Wouldn't you?

No, Arieol wouldn't continue, actually, and they don't.

We lie to ourselves, don't we?

They'd just written their mentor and CEO of Malt Gibsey World, Oren Progresso, a letter about such an idea, though of course they'd never sent it and Progresso would likely never even take the time to read it if they did (after all what CEO actually reads?), but the letter they would send, scratching itself across the next few pages, it maybe held (or holds) the answer.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 1"},{id:"444",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 1",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:444,text:`And this was how the letter began.

Ladies and Gentleman, Boys and Girls, Animals, Beasts, Birds of the Air, Fish of the Tempestuous Sea, Vibrations Within the Many Minds of the Multiplicitous Truly Fictional Gibseys, All You Diseased Collections of Surfacing Facial Features and Signs, Here to Show Yourself and Be Recognized, Welcome!

Welcome to the letter that Arioel Owlist, who will here be referred to as The Author, has written (or is writing, or will write, depending on your POV) for their mentor, employer, and audience, Oren Progresso, on some unspecified date.

We begin this letter with the idea of personal pain, what Joseph Campbell referred to as a hero's trial, what the Buddhists referred to as suffering, what the psychologically minded call trauma, or what the magically inclined call a curse, and more specifically, we begin this letter with the pain Arieol has been experiencing as of late, causing them to take a sick day from their work of transcribing data for Oren Progresso's recent auto-biographical screenplay, sick days being a sacred and productive time for Aeriol, as has already been said or shown (if not both, most hopefully), sick bastard that they are, and they, as The Author, would like to mention that referring to such pain is not meant to engender pity or remorse from any future audience-however individualized or, like Jackaroo's hands, small it, or they, may be-and is instead simply meant to provide some context for why the text currently winding itself across the page has taken the form it's taken, though admittedly, maybe such filler is asinine?

Shouldn't the slime, the ground man, this ruinous clay, shouldn't it be given the chance to rise up, all on its own?`,section:11,chapter:"Part 1"},{id:"445",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 2",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:445,text:`Maybe what we need is to abandon altogether the concept of rising?

Maybe what The Author needs is a different kind of movement?

We must remind ourselves that the goal here isn't to sound eloquent or impressive, the goal is to be honest, and if honesty produces ugliness, then so be it, we'd rather be ugly and truthful than beautiful and false, though we admit that maybe there's a way to be both beautiful and true?

But that way hasn't yet been found.

So we proceed with ugliness.

The Author has been experiencing a particular kind of pain, and though the pain isn't new, their articulation of it is, and the articulation goes like this:

They feel powerless.

Not just professionally powerless, though that's certainly part of it (transcribing Progresso's work rather than creating their own), but powerless in a more fundamental way, powerless over their own thoughts, their own actions, their own story.

They feel like a character rather than an author.

And this feeling has been growing stronger lately, particularly since they began this investigation into The Author's identity, this search for Jacklyn Variance, this consideration of Jack Parlance as a suspect, this wondering whether they themselves might be The Author.

Because what if they are?

What if they're The Author, but they don't have any control over what they write?

What if they're both the writer and the written?`,section:11,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"446",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 2",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:446,text:`This is the nature of the curse, if we can call it that.

To be conscious of being fictional, but not conscious of being in control of the fiction.

To be aware that your thoughts might not be your own, that your words might be dictated by someone else, that your actions might be predetermined, but to be unable to do anything about it.

To suspect that you might be The Author, but to feel like you have no authorial power.

This is what The Author means when they speak of powerlessness.

And this powerlessness has practical consequences.

For instance, The Author finds themselves unable to finish things.

They start letters like this one, but they don't send them.

They begin investigations, but they don't complete them.

They have ideas for their own stories, their own narratives, but they never write them down, never develop them, never share them with anyone.

Instead, they transcribe other people's work.

Instead, they live in other people's stories.

Instead, they wonder whether they exist at all, or whether they're just a figment of someone else's imagination.

And the wondering becomes a kind of paralysis.

The questioning becomes a kind of trap.

Because if you're not sure whether your thoughts are your own, how can you trust any decision you make?`,section:11,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"447",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 2",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:447,text:`If you're not sure whether your actions are predetermined, how can you feel responsible for anything you do?

If you're not sure whether you're real, how can you live authentically?

These are the questions that torment The Author.

And these are the questions that Progresso, in his wisdom or his indifference, would probably dismiss as "overthinking" or "philosophy" or "the kind of stuff that doesn't matter in the real world."

But for The Author, these questions are the real world.

These questions are what make the difference between a life worth living and a life that's just... happening.

So The Author writes this letter, not because they expect Progresso to understand or respond or care, but because writing it is one of the few actions they can take that feels genuinely their own.

Even if it isn't.

Even if this letter, too, is being dictated by someone else.

Even if The Author's attempt to assert their agency is just another plot point in someone else's story.

At least they're trying.

At least they're attempting to break free from the paralysis of uncertainty.

At least they're choosing to act, even in the face of their doubt about whether choice is possible.

And maybe that's enough.

Maybe that's what agency actually is: not the guarantee of free will, but the decision to behave as if you have it.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"448",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 2",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:448,text:`Maybe that's what courage actually is: not the absence of fear, but action in spite of fear.

Maybe that's what authenticity actually is: not the certainty of selfhood, but the commitment to behave as if you are who you think you are.

These are the insights that The Author hopes to convey to Progresso, though they suspect Progresso won't read this far into the letter.

Progresso is a busy man.

Progresso has important things to do.

Progresso has his own autobiography to write, his own story to tell, his own narrative to control.

Unlike The Author, Progresso doesn't seem to suffer from doubts about his agency.

Progresso acts.

Progresso decides.

Progresso creates.

And maybe that's what The Author envies most: not Progresso's success or his wealth or his position, but his apparent certainty about his own existence, his own power, his own right to shape the world around him.

Progresso doesn't wonder whether he's fictional.

Progresso doesn't question whether his thoughts are his own.

Progresso doesn't worry about whether his actions are predetermined.

Progresso just... is.

And acts accordingly.

Which brings The Author to the real purpose of this letter, the real question they want to ask Progresso, though they're not sure they have the courage to ask it directly.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"449",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 2",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:449,text:`The question is this: How do you know you're real?

How do you know your thoughts are your own?

How do you know your actions matter?

How do you know you're not just a character in someone else's story?

And if you are just a character, how do you live with that knowledge?

How do you find meaning in a fictional existence?

How do you assert agency when you suspect you might not have any?

These are the questions The Author would like answered.

These are the problems The Author would like solved.

But The Author suspects that Progresso doesn't have answers to these questions.

The Author suspects that Progresso has never even considered these questions.

The Author suspects that Progresso lives in a world where such questions are irrelevant, where doubt is a luxury, where certainty is the default state.

And maybe that's the real difference between them: not talent or ambition or opportunity, but the capacity for doubt.

Progresso doesn't doubt.

The Author can't stop doubting.

Progresso moves forward.

The Author moves in circles.

Progresso creates.

The Author transcribes.

Progresso is.

The Author wonders whether they are.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"450",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 2",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:450,text:`And yet.

And yet, The Author continues to write this letter.

And yet, The Author continues to search for answers.

And yet, The Author continues to hope that understanding might lead to action, that clarity might lead to agency, that truth might lead to freedom.

Even if the hope is misplaced.

Even if the search is futile.

Even if the letter will never be sent.

Because what's the alternative?

To give up?

To accept powerlessness?

To stop asking questions?

To stop trying to understand?

That seems like a kind of death, and The Author isn't ready to die yet, even if they're not sure they're alive.

So they continue.

They continue writing.

They continue questioning.

They continue hoping.

Not because they're certain it will lead somewhere, but because the alternative is unacceptable.

Not because they know they have agency, but because they choose to act as if they do.

Not because they're sure they exist, but because existing feels better than not existing, even if existence is fictional.

And maybe that's enough.

Maybe that's all anyone can do: continue.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"451",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 2",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:451,text:`So The Author will continue.

They will continue this letter, even though they suspect Progresso won't read it.

They will continue their investigation, even though they suspect it won't lead to answers.

They will continue their work, even though they suspect it doesn't matter.

They will continue their existence, even though they suspect it might be fictional.

Because continuing is a choice.

And choice, even the illusion of choice, feels like agency.

And agency, even the illusion of agency, feels like life.

And life, even fictional life, feels better than nothing.

Which brings The Author to another realization, another insight they'd like to share with Progresso:

Maybe the question isn't whether we have agency.

Maybe the question is whether we can create the experience of agency.

Maybe the question isn't whether we're real.

Maybe the question is whether we can create the experience of reality.

Maybe the question isn't whether our choices matter.

Maybe the question is whether we can create the experience of mattering.

In other words, maybe agency isn't something you have or don't have.

Maybe agency is something you do or don't do.

Maybe agency is a practice rather than a possession.

Maybe agency is a verb rather than a noun.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"452",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 2",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:452,text:`And if agency is a practice, then The Author can practice it.

They can practice making choices, even if they're not sure the choices are real.

They can practice taking action, even if they're not sure the actions matter.

They can practice asserting themselves, even if they're not sure they exist.

They can practice being an author, even if they're not sure they're The Author.

And maybe, through practice, the distinction between real agency and performed agency will become irrelevant.

Maybe, through practice, the experience of agency will become indistinguishable from agency itself.

Maybe, through practice, The Author will become what they're pretending to be.

This is what The Author hopes.

This is what The Author chooses to believe.

Not because they're certain it's true, but because believing it feels better than not believing it.

Not because they have proof, but because hope feels better than despair.

Not because they know it will work, but because trying feels better than giving up.

And so The Author will try.

They will try to practice agency.

They will try to create the experience of choice.

They will try to live as if their actions matter.

They will try to write as if their words have power.

They will try to exist as if their existence is real.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"453",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 2",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:453,text:`And maybe that trying is enough.

Maybe that trying is everything.

Maybe that trying is what separates characters from authors, even when the characters are authors and the authors are characters.

Maybe that trying is what creates agency out of powerlessness, meaning out of meaninglessness, reality out of fiction.

Or maybe not.

Maybe The Author is deluding themselves.

Maybe this letter is just another form of transcription, another way of recording someone else's thoughts.

Maybe their investigation is just another plot point in someone else's story.

Maybe their search for agency is just another way of demonstrating their lack of agency.

But even if that's true, even if The Author is deluding themselves, the delusion feels better than the alternative.

The delusion feels like hope.

The delusion feels like possibility.

The delusion feels like life.

And if life is a delusion, then The Author chooses the delusion.

If agency is an illusion, then The Author chooses the illusion.

If meaning is a construction, then The Author chooses to construct it.

Because despair is unbearable.

Because meaninglessness is unbearable.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 2"},{id:"454",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 2",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:454,text:`So The Author chooses to bear the bearable.

And maybe these choices don't matter.

Maybe these choices are predetermined.

Maybe these choices are illusions.

But they feel real to The Author.

They feel meaningful to The Author.

They feel like agency to The Author.

And if that's all agency is—a feeling, an experience, a construction—then The Author has achieved it.

Not permanently.

Not completely.

Not certainly.

But momentarily.

Maybe agency isn't about being certain, but about choosing despite uncertainty.

Maybe agency isn't about knowing, but about doing.

Maybe agency isn't about being real, but about living as if you're real.

Because even if everything is fictional, the experience of reality can still be lived.

Because even if everything is predetermined, the experience of choice can still be felt.

Because even if no one has agency, the experience of agency can still be practiced.

And agency, even temporary agency, even questionable agency, even illusory agency, feels like life.

So The Author chooses to live.

They choose to act.

They choose to hope.

Progresso, poker at the fire, has started with another of his many tirades he's sure to justify with the idea of how elders and/or mentors are to be respected, and were more often respected in the much older Gibseyan doctrines.

With Progresso, everything's always justified and interesting as long as it's older, archaic, and ancient, which doesn't bother Arieol in and of itself, but it does strike them with annoyance (as really does just about anything within such a dynamic of inequity, wouldn't it?) because it reeks of absolutism. Shape-shifter that they are, nothing is inherently any way for Arieol.

Cannibalism?

Of course it's been commonly spread around that people of Arieol's ilk were to be organizing to all start cannibalizing their mentors all at once, at some point they would anyway, all of them, together.

Or this was supposedly going to happen, at least.

And not that Arieol doesn't support and hope for such things to take shape, of course, he's hungry as anybody else who's fed scraps always is, but, good Gibsey were they going to need some luck with that most (un)holy of ambitious operations!

And additionally, was it their foolishness, already well summarized by that Fool card swinging in at the top of the game's 1st inning that had led them to such a fate?

But wasn't a fool, The Fool, something to be protected from harm, or which was protected from harm?

Or was that merely the non-reversed reading?

Maybe they should be considering negative possibilities, after all.

Pain itself was The Obstacle.

What else could the card even denote?

There was no curse but the curse itself.

But it didn't take long for Arieol to retreat from the full awareness of this idea-it never does for any of us-to send it back on down to the 1st observation, back to the scraggly old depths of the unconscious where it belongs, where it can whimper and pine for its lack of acceptance to please finally be healed, back with the wretched wastes of the rest of those ravenous thoughts of theirs.

Good Gibsey, they felt disturbed, and more and more everyday.

Wait, speaking of, hadn't they witnessed some fleshy monstrosity mending itself, winding itself atop Parlance's own skin earlier?

And Arieol had barely even noticed it, let alone Parlance!

All they'd done was write down a quick little note about it?

Malt Gibsey!

They needed to check back on the poor bastard!

And so they did, shape-shifter that they are.

Back at the bench, without any time seeming to pass at all.

They forget-shape-shifting, wandering, fragmenting-it all does come with its own non-linear benefits, after all.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 3"},{id:"478",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 3",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:478,text:`The boil, the juicy, gelatinous flesh-on-flesh, part-open-wound, part cauterized abreaction had crystallized itself further, fossilizing into a bulbous, twitching mass behind Parlance's knuckle.

It bounced as Jack typed.

Arieol covers their mouth in shock, their eyes wide, teeth chattering-that sort of thing-not quite cartoonish, but near-cartoonish, like something out of that Gibseyan classic Who Censored Roger Mexico, somewhere between animation and reality, suspended animation, or suspended reality, take your pick.

The growth, the wart, the boil, whatever it was, they noticed, in horror, that it had formed a face.

It was grimacing.

They were sure of it.

You had to squint your eyes to even notice it was there.

It almost blended into the surface of itself if you weren't looking carefully enough, meaning the face, of course, not the wart itself, though it didn't seem that Parlance was aware that this growth had appeared on him at all with it bouncing around like that, with him typing away like mad, and it just sitting there, growing. Obviously it didn't have the same height or opacity, but it reminded Arieol of those inflated displays you see at Used Car Dealerships, what even were they called?

Inflatable-men?

Why the fuck were they called that?

And what the ever living fuck was Arieol getting themselves into?

This was what.

It opens its mouth.

It starts to speak.

No, no, no, no, NO!

It can't be!

This very much deserves a reversed reading!

This is what burn-out looks like ladies and gentlemen.

This is some Frankenstein-type-shit, John Henry-type-shit, Lamkin-type-shit, born of the depths and twittering to return to it, all fleshy and pruney like your fingers when you've lingered in the bath for too long, all lumped and knotted and twisted, tiny folds of skin folded atop themselves.

Please stop speaking.

Please.

I don't want to hear it again.

The boil makes these clicking, popping sounds when it talks, like a still born struggling to come to life.

It struggles to keep its eyes open, almost as if it's inebriated, like it's falling in and out of consciousness, like when the heroine's surging through to both finally provide and take away all of the best parts of yourself.

"Oh, Arieol, my sweet," It sputters and spits, "My dear one, how can you be so naive? Don't be so daft. Haven't you ever met a talking boil before? Be realistic here, Arieol. You're a telepathic, shape-shifting low-life, wandering around doing task-after-task for your betters, over and over again, all without sleep, warmth, rest, or even basic decency, and all in the putrefying hell of this nightmare-scape we call Gibsey World.

The whole cliche of bile rising to Arieol's throat type image isn't necessary to provide here, especially since as reader, you're likely already experiencing the sensation yourself.

Such an image sure does create a sort of reality effect, does it not?

So do forgive the details.

Some of us are simply interested in the intensity of effects and much less on the particulars of any given content.

Content is more Gibsey's job to take care of, after all.

Arieol keeps asking themselves in that wandering, itinerant, spinning ride of a skull of theirs-Foolbear the Flying Giraffe style-why me? Why did this have to happen to me? And how is Parlance just sitting there typing away as this thing is swinging back and forth like that one jack-in-the-box in that classic Midnight Area episode with that tyrannical, telepathic little kid with the special powers?

And if so, what had caused them to perceive it?`,section:11,chapter:"Part 3"},{id:"481",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 3",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:481,text:`"Oh, Arieol, Arieol, please, oh!

It was twitching now, faster, and he was shocked, even further than before, totally frozen to the spot, and such a tundra was already Antarctic, to say the least.

They weren't doing anything.

They were just standing there, frozen.

"I'm not even doing anything!" They yell at the boil in desperation.

Actually, they're not sure they even yell this since Parlance's eyes haven't moved from off their keyboard.

"Oh, Oh! You're doing it-you're doing it with your mind, Arieol. Oh, oh yeah. Oh, Gibsey. Oh, OH! Oh, yes. Please, please! Harder! You're right there, Arieol. Get me! Get me riiiiight there, oh! Oh yeah! OH ARIEOL!"

Tears are running down their face, Arieol's face.

They beg the boil to stop.

"I'm not doing anything! I'm just standing here! Stop it! Please!"

"Oh, OH! I'm gonna pop! I'm gonna-"

The thing is-

My dear and astute reader-

No one wants to describe such material.

We just describe what comes to us, and well, uh, sometimes, you have to be a jazz musician that just continues on through whatever solo you've started despite the dissonance which has presented itself, so if the objects in such a scene had to, um, well, had to be described, and well, the thing is, we're already here-we've already begun, so we might as well finish describing them, right?-so if we had to, well, um, describe them: it shoots out, meaning out of the boil, meaning mucus, bile, residue, or maybe something else, surely, it shoots out of it, the boil, or whatever it is, and when it does, again, whatever it is that does, it shoots out like a volcano erupting.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 3"},{id:"482",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 3",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:482,text:`The residue spews out of a hole at the top of what could easily be called the boil's head, sort of like how water shoots out of the blow-hole of a killer whale, or maybe a solo, but the thing is, this wasn't a killer whale, it was a boil, an ejaculating boil, if the image isn't already clear.

And Arieol certainly thinks of a volcano when this occurs, a specific volcano, a number of volcanoes.

They think of that column of ash and heat that crushed the Oppenheimers to death (interesting last name, huh?) that Arieol first learned about from that one Gibseyan classic Werner Herzog documentary, Into the Inferno.

They think of Pompei.

They think of Dante.

They think of Enoch.

Yeah, they definitely think of them, feel like them, twirl them around in their tongue like a mint that's about to disappear forever, thinking back to so many that are soon to be crushed over and over by the unbearable heat.

And again, Arieol hasn't even done anything.

They've just been standing there, and they also know, at least sort of know, that similar to the cannibalism from before, this never really happened.

But the imagination is a very strange and powerful thing, after all.

More real than reality itself.

And this is especially true for a shape-shifter like Arieol.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 3"},{id:"483",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 3",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:483,text:`Sometimes, you're forced to make sacrifices you don't want to make by someone or something that you trust, and there's nothing you can do about it, even if it hurts, and even if it hurts you terribly but-

Maybe they've gone too far and let their perceptions get the best of them?

Maybe.

"You know what's great about being a masochist, Arieol?" The boil asks one last time, sputtering, still vibrating a little, still covered in the wastes of itself, "It means no matter what happens, you're always happy. No matter what." And then it collapses, so satisfied it doesn't even have the energy for a cigarette, the bastard, flopping over onto Parlance's knuckles like a uh, um, like a uh, um, well, um, we're just gonna, uh, we're gonna, we're just gonna, uh, we're just gonna stop right there.

At least if that's OK with you?

One can assume the need for such a transition away from that scene is mutual.

To give and bestow, as the Kaballists say.

Welp, that's quite enough of that!

Time to move on to other things now, shall we?.

Why not jump back to the Tarot cards?

The Tarot cards!

Can't forget they were being turned over, now, can we?

Back in some liminal space, some backyard, between the various episodes of the story.

We were on the third card!

Yes, the third card!

Thank Gibsey for that device!

Arieol turns it over.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 3"},{id:"484",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 3",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:484,text:`The VI of Pentacles.

Oh no.

Oh, dear Gibsey, no.

(You're just going to have to accept this is what you turned over. There's no changing it now).

No, it can't be.

No.

There's nothing weird about that at all!

Don't want to ignore that one and let the viewers, or readers, or data-analysts, fill in the gaps on that one!

And do remember folks, my dear and astute audience members, that some gaps aren't worth filling in.

Good, Gibsey!

It's uh, wow, uh, it just-it's really tough to be here folks.

It really is.

But let's just try to stay focused on the card, though, shall we?

The VI of Pentacles.

It's a card of giving and receiving.

A man with a stretched out hand, dispenses two coins to two beggars, and oh, wouldn't ya know, Arieol is on his knees nearly collapsing, eyes now dry from the pain of seeing all this occur, going through it.

Sometimes you just don't have a good time, and you just have a really, really bad day.

That's just how it is.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 3"},{id:"485",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 3",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:485,text:`Suffering.

It's a part of life.

Sometimes you need support.

And sometimes, you make the support you need because you aren't given it.

And sometimes you can't even do that.

But this card, well, it's not about that.

It's about balance.

How we should, uh, Oh Gibsey, how we should make sure to shore up our support for those that need it, even when it isn't being asked for.

Well isn't that just a great little karmic reminder!

But would-ya-look-at-this.

Parlance stops typing.

Jack Parlance stops their typing, there, still on the bench. and looks up.

He looks up, not to see the boil-which he doesn't, if it's even there-but to see the figure on their knees in tears before him with a look of total desperation and insanity etched across their face (meaning, Arieol's) a look of such desperation and horrified gloom and annihilation that even someone as aloof as Parlance knows that something is very much not OK right now.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 3"},{id:"486",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 3",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:486,text:`"You OK?" Parlance asks, surprised.

"This isn't going how I was expecting it to go at all!" Arieol sobs, balling. baffled.

And thus, in that moment of harrowing intensity, a bond is formed.

Parlance being the lonely-ass person that he is, as well, he's going to meet such desperation head on, and not with the cold shoulder it would normally receive, mind you, but with one of-sorry if the term(s) is/are a little Gibseyan-sisterly (or brotherly) love.

As a coder and writer of sorts, Jack's learned to identify with some of the strangest experiences one can imagine, after all, or hopes to, anyway.

Arieol collapses, sobbing, and Parlance stands up to put a hand on Arieol's shoulder, trying to comfort them, eventually getting them to sit back up.

And they talk for hours.

It'd be unfair to include the specific content of their talk here.

It would thwart the powers of a shape-shifter such as Arieol to fully give this experience shape, of course.

We can't have that happening.

Not that it's the content that matters, anyway, it's the form, the effect, and the effects that caused all this seem pretty clear, don't you think?

But do know that, as a stranger in that moment, Jack is very kind to Arieol about it, which is really sweet of him to do at the time, not knowing Arieol all that well and still comforting them and all.`,section:11,chapter:"Part 3"},{id:"487",symbolId:"arieol-owlist",title:"Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency Part 3",color:"#99CCFF",pageIndex:487,text:`And also, at the close of their harrowing discussion, Jack asks Arieol,"What's next? Something has to be coming next for you, doesn't it?"

Arieol sniffs, blowing their nose on their sleeve. "Well I'd failed to mention the 3rd card is typically what's called The Past."

"Oh, really?"Wow, you know what? It really seems like he's paying attention for once-old Parlance-it looks like he's going through some character development, even, however slight it may be.

Nice of him, really.

Neither of them were really used to seeing much of that within themselves, let alone their society.

Parlance in his own observations of his own daily behaviors, and Arieol as one who, like Jacklyn, has been keeping tabs on Parlance for the Agency of Data and Detection for quite some time.

"Do you have anything you could distract me with? What were you typing earlier?" Arieol chokes out between his fading sobs.

"Oh, it was just some shitty surrealistic autobiographical sketch."

"I'd read it."

"Yeah?"

"Let me see. I need all the fantasy I can get."

Jack hands Arioel his electronic typewriter, sun heading for the horizon, the battery growing low.

Is terror bona-fide terror if it's only partially perceived, glimpsed in the periphery rather than the center of the frame?

And if a man shits in the forest, are the trees the first to bristle at the gaseous odor or do they instead have to wait for its description to be stamped upon their surfaces in scarlet lettering?

Both options are a kind of forgetting, an unknowing, so the answer is neither, or both, which isn't an answer.

The fact is, there isn't always an answer.

Not always, but there are some answers, sometimes.

Sometimes, Jack Parlance gets lost, loses himself in these self-righteous loops of his where he thinks he's better than everybody else, which can often make him feel a little lonely, both out of guilt for feeling this way to begin with and out of the pure alienation of experiencing the feeling itself, which come to think of it, makes him feel a hell of a lot more than just a little bit lonely, truth be told. It can feel like the entire weight of existence is on his shoulders, and him alone. But then again, at other times, sometimes, he's able to notice this pattern, even the guilt, which allows him to correct himself, what his current therapist calls "self-monitoring," and come to think of it again, that word "monitoring" sounds an awful lot like surveillance, doesn't it? It's as if he's being made responsible for a fate which he cannot control.

He dreams of being a game developer, and he's always trying to think of ways he can add new content to the game he's coding, wants to add in the unexpected, even what he himself wouldn't expect to happen somehow. And that's what the players want, the constantly new. Newer and newer content for audiences never content. But our fate-and this is something that all games and gamers know all too well, games being nothing else but expressions of fate-is to always want the opposite of what we have at any given time, and so at such a time, when every desire is continually accessible, what is there left to desire? Is desire even possible in such an environment?

Pile it all on, all that endlessly cranked out content, pile it onto the shit pile that no one even has the time anymore to smell, let alone identify the smell of, even when words describing the shit pile are located, pruned, set into type-faced symmetrical poems that could loosen the tightest nun in the convent, if no one has the time to read them, what did it matter?

Where was it always disappearing off to?`,section:12,chapter:""},{id:"490",symbolId:"jack-parlance",title:"The Biggest Shit of All Time",color:"#FF3385",pageIndex:490,text:`Their time was like a child who didn't even care enough about their own father to even process that during their infancy, when he'd claimed he was just going off to buy a simple pack of Marlboro Reds, he'd instead shuffled off into the distance and out of their life, a child who didn't even care enough to even notice the absence, let alone the initial presence-it didn't even rattle around in the bingo machine of their brains, not even once.

And so where did the damn time go?

And who got to have the excess time?

Who took it away?

This was how energy worked, wasn't it? Always tending towards excess? Excrement. The ever-piling shit-pile. Gibstory's wastrel, guttural, repetitive chanting, destructive as a dripping faucet.

But there are also other times, other times when Parlance forgets he's past his prime, forgets he's even forgetting, and like all memories, these memories are fleeting, and therefore become harder and harder to include within the code of the game he's been working on for so long but which he's spent so little time actually creating.

It is the story of the funniest thing that's ever happened to him before, and the funniest aspect of the story, for him anyway, was that it was true--it actually happened.

He was at work.

End of the day, that grinding pulse you get in your gut where you just intuitively know it's better to go now rather than suffering with the knowledge of what it is you didn't do for the whole drive back.

And to be clear, this Biggest Shit of All Time wasn't of his own making; he happened upon it by chance. It was just sitting there, waiting to be found by whoever came along to witness its gravity and glory: the biggest shit ever to be found by anyone, ever, throughout all of recorded history.

Before he even first saw it floating in the porcelain tomb of the single-use office restroom, the smell had overwhelmed him.

But he didn't laugh immediately upon seeing it because it wasn't funny immediately.

No, not at all.

There was something terrifying about it, something threatening.`,section:12,chapter:""},{id:"492",symbolId:"jack-parlance",title:"The Biggest Shit of All Time",color:"#FF3385",pageIndex:492,text:`What he first noticed was that his initial need, what he'd come to that space to dispense of, had immediately dissipated.

The size of it was cosmic.

Multiple descriptive nouns could be applied to its indescribable frame: brick, log, chunk, rod, Pringles can, rolling pin. But these words would be intended to describe and represent objects, and this was no mere object.

This was a force, a force which brought objects towards itself, and much like the strangeness of a black hole, this force appeared to be part of the natural world.

It radiated a dark and unknowable energy.

He immediately understood the pertinence that if he was to get out of here without seeming like he was the culprit who'd desecrated the innocence of this hopelessly naive, otherwise well-meaning pearly-white vessel, he would have to be the one to flush it down.

And so of course, after his attempt, the flushing of the toilet, this eternal object-obstinate, unrelenting, unmoving, unstoppable, uncompromising- it remained.

And its stasis revealed a dark truth.

Whatever this was, it was not what was floating in the water, the water was what was floating within it.

There was a solidity and rigidity to its frame and structure, to the basic components of its very make-up, that he'd never encountered before within an object, as if its own molecules themselves contained their own, lower-level, yet-to-be discovered fundamentals.

He was convinced that if studied, whatever this was or whoever had created it, could reveal the secrets of the universe: Did life exist after death? Were there extraterrestrials? What about Gibsey? Who killed JR? Or even JFK? What has always been and would always continue to be the meaning of life? Why do we live only to suffer and die? Had he, in fact, left the oven on when leaving his apartment? Who the fuck was The Author of The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey? All of these burning questions could finally be laid to rest.

This, in addition to the gravity of the thing, the spiritual weight of it, was why, despite it being the funniest thing to have ever happened to him before, it hadn't initially struck him as funny.

This was a life or death situation.

His entire reputation was on the line.

If he was found in this restroom, he would immediately become the author of this object's dark secret. And if found, would he be cast out for creating such a monstrosity or would he be embraced for creating the uncreatable?

Or would his culture be split in two by the revelation, with him standing there, sealed by a fate which was out of his control?`,section:12,chapter:""},{id:"495",symbolId:"jack-parlance",title:"The Biggest Shit of All Time",color:"#FF3385",pageIndex:495,text:`He washed his hands as quickly as possible and exited into the safety of the unknowing outside of the restroom.

He'd been saved.

Whoever was next to be the one to come upon it would instead become the framed and eternal victim of the turd's unspeakable power.

The experience brought a whole new meaning to that eternal myth and oft quoted phrase, "Whoever smelt it dealt it."

But even despite its applicability, this eternal phrase would fall short because of the popularly known meaning of the phrase. In such a scenario, whoever communicates the smell in question would always become the dealter of said smell, this being due to their communication to another, to an other, about the said smell, to someone outside themselves, which means that communication of the smell itself is what seals one's fate in such a situation, but this-The Biggest Shit of All Time-was something else entirely, something new and unexpected, something with a much greater intensity of effect than mere communication.`,section:12,chapter:""},{id:"496",symbolId:"jack-parlance",title:"The Biggest Shit of All Time",color:"#FF3385",pageIndex:496,text:`If he was found at the scene of the crime, even if he didn't say a word and even worse, even if he hadn't been the perpetrator of the shit, he'd suddenly become the shitter of the said shit, and therefore would be forced to become the author and creator of the greatest shit ever to be shat by a singular shitter.

And this possibility had terrified him.

However, upon reaching the safety outside, he realized that this terror could shift and could even be transformed.

His chuckling first started as he walked through the hallway back to his office.

And after this, he couldn't stop.

And It wasn't just the size, weight, and unflushable permanence of the thing that started him cackling in the parking lot all the way home, that had him choking on his cereal the next day, or that years later-working from home-that had him sitting at his work space, twirling his fingers through his hair, imagining how he could somehow get the story of the event into the game he was creating; it was how he alone had been the one to find it and how impossible it would be to communicate it to anyone else.`,section:12,chapter:""},{id:"497",symbolId:"jack-parlance",title:"The Biggest Shit of All Time",color:"#FF3385",pageIndex:497,text:`Why was he even considering this event, he wondered, when he hadn't even coded more than a skeleton of the game itself?

What haunted Jack wasn't the shit itself, the size, the weight, the gravity, its refusal to be destroyed like all the others, the thousands of shits being slung down the many rivers of sewage flowing across the Gibseyan landscape, every single day--he wasn't even haunted by the many questions that the shit itself forced one to confront (Who could have even produced such a thing? Or was it even produced by someone at all? Had someone smuggled it in as a prank somehow? If so, why?). What haunted Jack was the eternal inability of sharing the experience, the clarity and unchangeable alienation of the intimacy of his newly received knowledge.

Not at all.

It had been for him alone to find.

The fact is, there isn't always an answer as to why you alone are the one to find it.

Not always, but there are some answers, sometimes.

Sometimes, you just have to sit at your desk, type away at your code in continual toil, knowing that no one else, not a single other person in the world but you, will even be able to share in the memory of it, let alone its perception.

And there was nothing funny about this at all.

If anything, it was the least funny thing he could think of.

Or was it?

It was a death, a series of small deaths, but he noticed, had often noticed, that these deaths, however small they may be, were the sort of things, unlike his hidden knowledge of The Biggest Shit of All Time, that would continually accumulate and persist, that could never be flushed down, however many times he'd try to flush.`,section:12,chapter:""},{id:"499",symbolId:"jack-parlance",title:"The Biggest Shit of All Time",color:"#FF3385",pageIndex:499,text:`There was a mountain of shit, and it would pile forever.

This newly parasitic outgrowth-or return to Phillip Bafflemint's original story-begins with one of those classically cliche scenes commonly found within the opening sections of novels written by amateurish writers busy hitting tennis balls against the garage door-sigh-the cliche of a character waking up to greet the day of some newly acquired situation.

However, with this being the space where Phillip Bafflemint's soon to be developed inciting incident is to occur-a redundant and cliched term itself since, what can an incident do but incite?-the cliche in this case may not just be homogeneously repetitive, and may even also be true.

Not only this, but upon waking up on the damp carpet, Phillip realizes that the spinning ride of his unbearable vertigo has dissipated, and other than the fact that evening has fallen into night, he feels relatively back normal.

In fact, there's a knock at the door of 19991 Thanatos Drive.

And what were the odds?`,section:13,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"502",symbolId:"manny-valentinas",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir- Chapter 4- The Slip and The Mistake",color:"#FFB000",pageIndex:502,text:`Phillip's clearly left the door half-open because rather than waiting for him to stand up and open the door himself, a woman walks into the house to greet him.

"Ah, thank goodness someone's here. I do say. Old Valentinas wasn't going to put this place in order himself, and someone had to! And look what you've done with such rigor and gusto!" They look down upon him as he lifts himself to stand and greet them. They continue, "For the pudgy and average-looking every-man you appear to be, the work you've done here is quite inspiring. Look at all you've done within this place! But also darling, whatever have you been doing laying down there on the floor? It's quite damp, after all. Oh, and do tell, what is your name?"

Phillip freezes, letting out an awkward "uh" noise that sounds like a whoopee cushion being stabbed by an ice pick. He loudly gulps, stuck, wishing he was still excavating one of the Moleskins from the blinds instead being interviewed by this intensely quizzical inquirer.

For all he knows this is a crime scene, and he could now be accused of tampering with the scene of the crime.

You know, Manny himself created a character whose own reactions were quite similar. This was a mystical detective novella which he originally authored.

Sounds flat out vain if you ask me. What? Is the abyss not dainty or beautiful enough for you to look at?"

Phillip manages to stand but also feels put on the spot somewhat, even though he's familiar with the novel, he stops himself from making any more sounds, and his silence speaks volumes, or seems to anyway.

"Young man, I am not an abyss, last time I checked, so what is it with this look of struggling stupefaction etched across your face? I'm not looking for a non-fictional repetition of the Glyph Marrow situation here, thank you very much. I've read that work already, so do speak up! Inaction is a form of violence.

"I do not."

For a moment, it felt like a smile flashed across her face before shifting, but Phillip is unsure.

He's gonna keep his eye on this one, that's for certain.

She continues, "But that's a very strange detail to mention, Mr. Bafflemint. Most certainly.

Being a detective is quite an intuitive job, and although he does get a sense that she's been toying with him somewhat since she walkid in, he doesn't feel this woman to be a threat to either himself or the case. Though, as always with the x and y axis, only time and space would tell.

Plus he does remember vague scatterings filtering in from his earlier dream with the ear about the name "Manny Valentinas" being important, and with his dreams being a space that this woman likely wouldn't have access to, he especially perks up hearing the name repeated.

It was either an innocuous slip made by accident that pointed to nothing, an accidental slip that suggested something hidden of the darker variety, or it could even have been a purposeful slip that she'd intended to make seem like an accident, likely to get him to pay attention to her more. The latter possibility is what he senses as being the most accurate. She does seem to enjoy having a little fun with him, or at least at his expense, and for all he knew, that tendency wasn't just the happy-go-lucky-kind and could even be full-on sociopathic glee, so he'd keep watching her.

And yes, you heard me correctly, I did contact the police to tell them about Manny's disappearance. I've been greatly concerned for his well being ever since he vanished.

I feel it will be oh so important to find out what's happened to him. What would you say? Tell me, have you noticed anything in all these papers of his?"

Philip doesn't even know where to begin."Well, there's a lot to sort through. It's a little repetitive, but I suppose I need to see it all in full once I've collected it all together? I've noticed I-" He stops himself for a moment, realizing he's letting her ask him questions, and that as such, that she's taken control of their exchange. He continues to humor her a bit, realizing he'll have to search for an edge to break back in. "I've noticed at least what appears to be 16 major narratives, many of which are centered on Artificial Intelligence, though that doesn't seem to be the central subject as a whole, and may be a more secondary subject than I originally thought, but I can't quite tell just yet.

Come to think of it, some circles do call that a religious science, don't they?"

Phillip tries to butt in. "I appreciate this, but I have a different case to look into, so I don't want to get too caught up-" And yet he can already feel himself getting caught up in it like some sailor to the call of a siren, "Well, maybe one more thing. There is a large amount of material that covers a fictional amusement park called Walt Disney World? Have you heard of it?"

"A fictional theme park?" She smiles, and he again notices a startling flash of something he can't quite make out, a gleam that seems to glitch across her eyes like lightning reflecting off glass, "Yes, I've heard of it.

"Well, let me tell you, darling. Manny was obsessed with reality and fiction, so much so that you could say he mixed the two up completely. Blended them together. And that's a dangerous set of potions to be working with. Not so much individually, but together, when mixed, externalities tend to present themselves. That's why the A.D.D. training manuals say to deepen either side, but they never say to mix the two. I-I was hoping you were the detective-" She trails off, pausing, her jovial serendipity seeming to thump into a more withdrawn sadness of, a retreat, a shift that reassures him about the truth of Manny's possible disappearance, and that maybe, with such emotional involvement, maybe she hadn't contributed. However, he leaves that possibility to hang back on a more subconscious level, for now. The novelty of the material he's collected and still collecting is much too overpowering for him to ignore, after all.

I'm confused?"`,section:13,chapter:"Chapter 4"},{id:"510",symbolId:"manny-valentinas",title:"An Expected Appearance: A Phillip Bafflemint Noir- Chapter 4- The Slip and The Mistake",color:"#FFB000",pageIndex:510,text:`She laughs, though again, the air does seem to have been taken out of her sails. Her voice seems depleted of the energy and vitality she first began the conversation with, almost sounding brittle now. He notices her voice crack a few times and wonders if she may be choking on her words, "I've often found that phrase to be amusing, Attention Deficit Disorder." She frowns, glitching, her mouth twitching, before shifting back into what she'd brought up. "Subject and Object, right? If we're talking about a kid with ADD and we think of them as a subject of the disorder, as being subjected to it, then the phrase would mean that they have trouble paying attention, that they struggle to stay focused, correct? And that's how it's typically thought of, as an internal experience, and so internally, subjectively, their attention would be thought of as being deficiently disordered, would it not? But what about if conceived of as an object? Well, then it would be an external problem rather than an internal one, wouldn't it? And what would the phrase then mean? How would it shift? It would mean that their life is deficiently disordered by attention, right? Attention would then be an external problem and not an inward one. It would no longer be one's responsibility. We all want to be seen and heard, don't we? So this would mean that a lack of external attention would be what's causing the problem. You see, I think of that disorder so differently now than I ever used to, at least ever since thinking of it this way. So many of us have it, supposedly. I think something like 50% of the population? That's an astronomical number of people. All those papers. All that content. Overload. It can feel like there's too much to take in, even for an astute professional such as yourself, I'm sure." Her words are the same, but she seems tired, weary, as if carrying these phrases on her back to reach some physician across town, "But darling, what if it wasn't that there was too much to take in. What if it was that we weren't being given enough attention? Maybe it's really about loneliness? Maybe the over-excitability, the distractibility, the lack of focus, the inattention, maybe it's because most of us, half of us even, weren't being focused on, weren't being given the attention that we needed.

If anything, he feels bad for her, senses she's struggling with something important. It feels like she's been hired to give a performance and she's now just going through the motion. It's as if she has the words memorized, but the feeling behind them is now gone. What had happened to her to cause such a change? What had she said? Something about mixing the scientific and the religious? Subjectivity and objectivity? Or was it reality and fiction? And did it have something to do with the disappearance of Manny Valentinas?

Or wait, what about London Fox?

"But-" She continues on as if he'd never even asked if she was OK, "But how are we going to better our situations if they're always one-sided, and we're always the ones footing the bill? Surely that's a lot of pressure to place on individuals, wouldn't you say, darling?"

There it is. There's the transition back into the case. If there was anything Phillip didn't have, it was A.D.D.

All he has to do is then switch over to London Fox.

In a world of this much variance, you could always return, even if they said and thought you didn't.

Her mouth shakes, but then she swallows some thought and returns back to the mask of her jovial self. "Ah, I do miss him, miss him even just hearing you asking about him. I'm sure he was, as am I, at times, and aren't we all? I can't tell you why he's disappeared. I don't know why he has. myself. And that's why I called you here. I need your help.

Her content may be worse, or at least different, but she's managed to return to her original form. "I do have a theory. I've been worried about bringing it up out of fear that it could taint your perceptions throughout the case, but who am I kidding? Manny always didn't believe in spoilers, probably because such a mindset placed too much emphasis on the external, on the effects others have on us. You are the author of your own reality, so write the story that you want to create."

It's essentially committed to the idea that even in the most chaotic and disorganized of systems are underlying laws, structures, forms, patterns, and the like.

"Well that's the interesting thing, dear. Even the smallest connections can make quite a big bang, as they say. What Carl Jung called Synchronicities. Everyone's so afraid of that word nowadays, think it's insane to believe that anything's connected to anything else at all, that one should only ever make objective connections, but that's the thing about Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions, it's science's version of Synchronicity. The smallest error can have wide ranging consequences. Think of the Butterfly effect, darling. So what this means is that just because you think that the mystical among us would have a small effect, such as Manny Valentines, that doesn't make it so. There are even marginalists in Economics, darling, who believe that even the smallest incremental changes can have wide ranging externalizing effects. Maybe somewhere in this house, this palace of memories, could be the piece of data which could unlock the key of your very case, or could be the initial conditions for which it all depends, as they say.

"Oh, most certainly darling, two events which seem to connect while having no discernible causal connection, precisely"

"But that's not the same thing? Randomness, coincidence, that's all just pure chaos. It isn't organized. Look, I'm a detective. I have to prove how either London Fox or Manny Valentinas disappeared, why it happened, and who caused it. I can't just say there seems to be a causal connection between this fictional theme park and the Disney company and therefore they've killed him.

Manny's a good friend of mine who meant, and still means, the world to me, so it's fine, darling. Like I said, it's just a theory I think of from time to time. And isn't that the thing about theories? They're like magic. In magic, you have an idea, an intent, you foster connections over time, and you perform rituals to make these ideas come true. You maintain a practice to test a theory, whether magician or scientist. So just try it out. Try it. Try putting my theory into practice. and see if you get results. If you don't get the results, then I was mistaken, and it was a bad theory, or a bad intent, or hypothesis, or whatever you want to call it.

"Why? Tell me."

"Well, it's really a rather small thing, really, which I'm trying to use to create a larger effect. I was trying to bury myself into your subconscious, darling, digging myself deep, deep underground into the recesses of your conscious and unconscious mind. You see, I'm a Subversionist, and what Subversionists of my ilk are concerned with, more than anything, is the creation of effects. I have very little interest in reality. If I can get you to think that I have something to do with the disappearance, then you'll go deeper into the case, won't you? And with Manny being a dear friend of mine, that's an effect I'm striving to achieve, darling. But how did you know I was even doing this? I really didn't expect you to realize?"

Attentional deficits doing what they do best, right? A slip is when you intend to do one thing but you end up doing something else by accident. It's usually due to some sort of subconscious error of some kind. For example, you might not be paying attention and you intend to click on the save button, but you hit the delete button instead. That's not a purposeful or intentional error, that's just a subconscious accident, right? And that's what makes a slip, a slip. They're not based on conscious awareness. They're unconscious.

"But mistakes are the opposite. Mistakes are conscious errors that result from a faulty plan or decision. For example, let's say that I like red sofas, and imagine that I create such a sofa to give to you for your birthday, thinking that because I liked them that you will, as well, only to find out later that I made a mistake, and that you instead only liked blue sofas and that my assumption was based purely on own faulty assumptions. That's a true mistake because I had to make a conscious choice that was then proven to be incorrect. It wasn't a subconscious error or an accident, like a slip. That's what makes a mistake a mistake. It's conscious. Am I making sense?"

"Yes, darling.

Your fake intentional slip was a mistake and your mentioning of it as a conscious mistake was a subconscious slip. But it can't be both. It's one or the other, and so you showed your hand. You wanted me to consider your innocence and your guilt simultaneously. But why?"

"You really are quite clever, darling. However, did you come to be this way?"

Phillip Bafflemint stands rooted to his spot, waiting in that cluttered, semi-flooded house, confounded as he so often is.

Judy had come across fairly ominously back there. He won't be able to shake the strangeness of their interaction from his mind, yet somehow, he still doesn't want to believe it, and come to think of it, the info he's collected on Manny Valentinas has become increasingly sparse, let alone the info on London Fox. He doesn't even know what either of them looked like, or if either of them even exist or even disappeared, or even which one he was supposed to be pursuing any longer, for that matter. All he knows is that one of them wrote a lot to the point that it's cluttered up their living space, and that whomever they were, they were deeply mystical, had an interest in both religious and scientific fields-an oddity, for sure, but not unheard of, although maybe more common in ancient contexts rather than modern ones-and maybe most importantly, or seemingly most importantly, that they'd created a theme park.

But that last factoid was uncertain, as well.

Walt Disney World.

As he drives home, he can feel his hands shaking as he grips the steering wheel.

What's wrong with him?

Was it the name he'd seen?

But what did it matter?

Had Judy been trying to get him wrapped up in some legal battle with Gibsey or something?

Everyone could forgive unconscious errors because they were accidental. They weren't purposeful. They were circumstantial and therefore didn't force one to take blame for them. But mistakes, on the other hand, functioned in an opposite way.

They necessitated blame.

Surely his world would be improved if mistakes were corrected more harshly and slips were given more grace, or at the very least, more understanding.

Or maybe there isn't as much of a difference between the two?

Maybe it should be gracious understanding all the way down?

After all, how can you be blamed for something you're not even able to be fully conscious of while it's happening?

Or maybe even this itself was simply wishful thinking.

As fantastical as Gibsey World itself.

He notices his speedometer, and realizes it's time to get gas.

Only about 30 miles left in the tank.

Wait, that's not a slip or a mistake of his is it?

But even thinking about that, hadn't Judy been the one to make that point, not he himself, so how self-organizing was he really being if--

He grips the steering wheel, grinds his teeth, and tries not to overthink it, at least as best he can.

He pulls into a gas station, happy to step out of the car and do something other than silently thinking to himself. Even if was simply handing a 20 dollar bill to a gas station clerk, it would be better than being inside his own head with these thoughts of his, and he's right. When he gets out of his car and tries to pay for the gas at the pump, the machine doesn't accept his card for some reason.

And additionally, how was he to know that, at this very moment, as he walks into the gas station, that one of the strangest and most important slippages of his life was about to occur, a slippage that even he couldn't ignore?

As he walks into the gas station, he opens the door and immediately notices a piece of data, a clue, which he doesn't understand.

The entire front vestibule of the convenience store inside is packed with souvenirs of various shapes, sizes, and formats: t-shirts, stuffed animals, travel mugs, toys, spray bottles, key chains, lanyards, figurines, even sets of what appear to be wearable ears of some kind, which all appear to be like something out of a classic Gibsey World souvenir shop, and since Phillip does live near the Magical Dominion area of his world's civilization, such items were familiar to him.

It appeared to be a mouse of some kind?

And then a thought comes to him.

Shamrock Stillman sits alone in his resort Bungalow late at night.

He's thinking about Glyph Marrow.

The kid hasn't reported back in awhile, and he's starting to worry. Can't quite put his finger on it, this feeling, more than typical worry, if he's being honest. The amber-colored scotch in his glass ripples as he taps the side of it with his finger, and the ice cubes clink, and the sound they make remind him of Glyph somehow.

He shuts his eyes, let's himself think about it.

But such clarity doesn't come, and he's left just as mystified by his own emotions as ever.

Feelings didn't belong in his line of work.

Maybe he'd even compartmentalized the intelligence from himself? For all he knew, maybe that was why when he walked from his bedroom to the kitchen, his legs felt like they'd been planted atop the tumbling hurl of a roller coaster, swimming up and down, G-forces and all. Might make himself sick if he isn't careful.

He tries to steady himself for a moment, hand against the Dickey Dog Seated Beneath a Palm Tree style wallpaper.

And strangely enough, the case he'd put on Glyph was already over. Whole thing was a sham. Faulty intelligence.

Other agents claimed the relationship between Oren and Arieol had become strained, as of late. Arieol's been almost as tough to get solid info on as Jacklyn Variance, which does spook Stillman a bit especially with Progresso being CEO and all, but time would have to tell. Stillman's been in the business long enough to know that with most intelligence, it's a waiting game. Data never lied, sometimes it just took time for the right data to be detected, but nothing ever truly escaped detection. Nothing. Not for the ADD, and especially not for Shamrock Stillman.

As the water heats up, like this theme park civilization of theirs, it wants to expand-mind of its own-but confined by the rock and overlying water, it can't, and so the pressure builds and builds until a critical point, a climax, where the water bursts forth, ascends into spectacular eruption.

He hurries west toward the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad in the Boundaryland area of the park, Glyph's favorite ride. Stillman was actually the one that had purchased an annual pass for Glyph, otherwise the poor sucker wouldn't have been able to afford it.

Welcome back.

Yes, OK. I'm going to be a bit rushed today since I was so, let's just say informal, in my previous lecture. I'm going to be purely focusing on the Gibstory, so today will sadly be much less based in dialogue and I will be talking to you through monologue alone, sadly.

Sometimes that's just how it has to be when you've got content to convey and there's no other way to convey it.

I'd love to be as digressive and focused on discussion and dialogue as I was in our previous lectures, but we have purposes to attend to, larger purposes, or maybe the purposes of each are of a similar size but the method of accomplishing each is going to force us to handle the Gibstory here a little more typically than we had before.

I'm sure you've heard of the idea of how we should show rather than tell when we convey information to our audiences. Being a student here, you likely had such slogans branded onto your brain at birth, but today will be one of those days where I tell you a Gibstory to show you a few things, the Gibstory of the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride, more specifically.

But this Gibstory doesn't start with the ride itself and instead starts, like so many of our Gibsories, within the initial amusement park that inspired our civilization, Gibseyland.`,section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"613",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:613,text:`Malt Gibsey had a vision of creating not just a theme park, but a crafted and created world, a living world, a world of sculptural delight where fact and fiction, meaning and magic, all blurred into a brilliant convalescence, and this vision of his, Gibseyland, opened way, way far back when time still existed and was even regularly recorded, opening at the center of America's most westward state, California in July, 1955.

There's billions of things I could cover about the Gibstory of that park, literally. Its collective Gibstory knows no bounds, cannot be contained. When every decade becomes a time to celebrate Gibseyland's anniversary, and then every year, and then every month, into every minute and second, and soon to be millisecond, and so on, it comes as no surprise that the data which has been collected over Gibseyland's Gibstory is enormous. And it has always been an American tradition to obsess over such mindless trivialities.

So it should come as no surprise that one has to specialize when considering the Gibstory of this ride.

Our Gibstory begins in the first year of the park's opening, in the Boundaryland section of the park where the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument ride was later to be built.`,section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"614",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:614,text:`It's interesting, this section of the park, in its planning stages, was originally going to be titled something to do with the Frontier, a concept that still remains tied to that area of the park, though maybe in more of a subconscious or backstage level since the designers eventually decided on Boundaryland. The name of that area of the park almost ironically conjures a limitlessness of boundaries. If it is a land of boundaries, then does it not suggest that they expand outward, manifest destiny style? Boundaryland doesn't sound like a land that enforces a single boundary, but that expands them. And if so, what would it have meant if the original title had been used, something like Frontier Plaza or Frontier Expanse or whatever was originally proposed at the time that eventually became Boundaryland? Would the idea of the Frontier then actually suggest a limitation? Did the word Frontier contain within itself, its own troubled and endless death?

But to connect back to what I was saying earlier, this area of the park did connect to concepts related to the American Frontier, specifically the romanticized exaggerations of the western Frontier that Gibsey itself had conjured through characters such as Davy Crockett, rugged individualists who traversed the wastelands of the American westward expanse, trailblazing their way through boundary-pushing adventures across the untamed plains of their wild, ever-expanding nation.

And in this way, the concept of the Frontier is an essential Gibseyan concept, one that can be seen in one of Gibsey's most classic promises that as long as there is still magic left in the world, the parks will never end.`,section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"615",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:615,text:`It should be expected then that Boundaryland would be the most expansive area of the park, and it was, taking up one-third of Gibseyland's 60 acre plot, much of it dominated by the Rivers of the Frontier section of the park which houses the Mark Twain Riverboats that can still be seen in many of that park's modern recreations floating their way across the streams of that woodland delta.

Budgets were tight in the park's early days, and the Riverboat existed as the singular mechanical attraction of the area, at least until the Rainbow Revene Mine Train ride was later conceived as budgets were expanded and further construction was implemented after the park's iconic initial success.

Boundaryland was inspired by the ghost towns which themselves had been transported into a similar Californian theme park which Gibsey drew inspiration from, Tangleberry Farm, drawing from much of that park's frontier theming, its stagecoaches, pack mules, wagons, among other similar diaspora, and it was these sorts of thematic resonances that Malt was going for when it came to constructing this area of the park and the ride which would provide the early inspiration for the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument ride, the Rainbow Revene Mine Train. The ride was to be an educational journey through nature similar in style to that of the nature documentaries Malt Gibsey Studios were known for developing at the time.`,section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"616",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:616,text:`Guests started the ride by boarding a 7-car mine train that exited from the storefronts of the desert mining town of Rainbow Revene. The mine trains themselves provided an ingenious exploration of Gibsey's relationship to realism, which as I'm sure you're well aware, is mostly non-existent. The scale of the trains aren't to the standard scale and instead provide a series of scales meant to create a state of immersion within their riders, essentially an emotive effect, rather than a realistic recreation. The trains themselves were not the steam trains either which they were meant to resemble and were instead electric trains, their batteries hidden in the front car near where the cast-member conductor sat.

This may be a bit of a digressive Gibstorical fact, but I find it an interesting point that the fork-lift batteries used to power these trains baffled engineers at the time. Typically, batteries of this kind needed to be replaced somewhere around a year after operation, and after 18 months, the manufacturer contacted Gibseyland, only to find out that the batteries were still going strong. After 2 ½ years, the manufacturer contacted the company to check on the batteries, assuming the company had gone with a different brand, but no, these same batteries were still being used and were functioning as well as they ever had. Even 3 years later, Gibsey had not needed any replacements to these batteries, a miracle which shocked the battery's manufacturer, who sent representatives to find out what magic Gibsey was conjuring to extend their life span at such great length. Sounds flat out Biblical, doesn't it? They found out that the ride operators had been trained to run the train cars until each battery's usage was all the way in the red zone, near the battery's total depletion. Then and only then could the battery be recharged. This meant that no deposits formed at the bottom of the batteries, which had essentially eliminated the degradation process entirely. Interesting, no? Shows how, even in its earliest days, Gibsey's obsession was an obsession with the extension of life, of energy. Gibsey World, and therefore Gibseyland, was always a battery, a landscape which generated and sustained various energetic principles, or maybe even which captured them, colonized them from their guests, and still does, still remains an extension of energy and life, if not a draining of it, which Malt promised would never accrue degradation, that it would go on forever, the end of Gistory, and as far as we can tell, like those batteries, it still has.`,section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"617",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:617,text:`Fictional town fronts built entirely of wood housed the attraction and were later expanded out past the attraction itself to house various shops and dining locations in that area of Boundaryland. These town fronts were built to take advantage of forced perspective, a technique that uses optical illusion to make objects or scenes appear different in size, distance, or scale than they actually are. This technique was used in most of Gibseyland's structures, sculptures, and monuments, including what I'd referred to earlier, the trains of the Rainbow Revene Mine Train themselves. The wooden scaffolding of the buildings which were closer to the view of the guests were built at 5/8ths scale, but as they moved further up, their scales moved down from 5/8ths scale to half scale, even as far down as to 1/4th scale in the buildings furthest back, making any cast members moving through them look like giants in comparison, Angels of Death even, which was typically avoided of course. This provides another reminder among many that this land was always intended as a land of effects. It was not a land of truth or realism, and this connects to one of the key features of Gibseyan Mysticism which holds to similar ideas. It is the effects of things, not their root causes, which are most worth considering. This idea is not one embraced by those committed to mainstream Gibseyanity who would maybe even view such ideas as radical, and maybe even blasphemous if applied in many contexts. Many would likely even compare such ideas to the ravings of some mad trickster Gibsey here to pull the rug out from under us, and yet this concept of effect, of forced perspective, of optical manipulation, is the structure of our own Gibstory, and the way many of our landscapes were developed and intentionally constructed.

The mystics merely leave us to our own devices.`,section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"618",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:618,text:`Similar to the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad, the ride began by exiting the station and entering a tunnel, The Tunnel, turning right out the tunnel to pass under a rock bridge to witness guests riding pack mules above. The trains then passed into the living desert, passing cacti, craggles of rock formations, tumbleweeds, as well what would later be designed into the ride, the sculptured animatronics of Markus Davies, the classic early Gibseyan animator and designer of many of the park's earliest and most iconic ride animatronic figurines and set pieces, most of these being repurposed animatronics from other areas of the park. Like any great Imaginator, Davies had a unique skill at being able to repurpose, you could even say re-appropriate, various artifacts, harnessing them for his own unique purposes, a form of boundary expansion, no?

The trains then passed through a long section that looped through a charming set of spinning rock formations (or really, more rock sculptures, forced perspective and all) before rounding the loop and spying a mine entrance ahead and a few scattered animatronic coyotes howling at the trains as they passed. I want to remind you that such devices were not common to attractions of the time period. For such a conservative organization, it has always been rather odd how obsessive Gibsey has also always been about modern technological advancements. It's a strange contradiction at the heart of their project, the old and the new. Electric trains are passing through a ghost town even in this early of an attraction, after all, and such connective repetitions are a little surreal, if you think about them.`,section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"619",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:619,text:"The trains then enter the finale, the climax of the attraction, The Caves. Although the space of this area was rather slight, its designers were able to craft quite the climactic moment for their audience members through the use of darkness and forced perspective, 22 water sculptures, wonders, sculpted stalactites, stalagmites, and cavernous environmental wonders. The designers used neon chalk to simulate the rainbowed lighting of various pools, waterfalls, and geysers This area was the crowning achievement of the ride's set pieces. The train would slow down to let passengers soak in the breathtaking views, one even flowing with six colors of the rainbow, posing a particular challenge to the ride's engineers. If colored chalk was to be used to create such effects, how would all the colors not splash, blur, and mix together, swirling into an opaque gray? They developed a mesh of thin synthetic fibers which eliminated nearly all of the splashing of the water when it hit the bottom of the falls, extending the life of the rainbow fountain, and because the mesh was transparent, blacklights could be hidden below and shined up at the waterfall, illuminating the falls with startling artificiality. Again, it was a mixture of the old and the new, natural wonders and human engineering, the blending of the subversive and the traditional that would bleed into a formless gray in less trained hands, the essence of the Gibseyan mindset and accomplishments.",section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"620",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:620,text:`Guests loved the ride, which inspired Malt to hire Markus Davies to expand its ornamentation upon the ride's success. Markus created new lands and scenery for the ride, and would play a role in influencing what would later be developed with the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad, for good or ill. Markus Davies was an expert of devices. Like the greatest artists and Imaginators, there was nothing he couldn't repurpose and contextually redesign. For example, an early portion of the ride had two simple animatronic foxes whose heads were swaying to and fro. In Davies' expansion of the ride, he repurposed these otherwise banal animatronic foxes, placing them closer to one another, and thus creating a comic scene where the foxes seemed locked in a disagreement of some kind, despite their initial separation.

Again, we have the shifting of perspective, the importance of the manipulation of context within the Gibseyan Mystical, one could even say magical, mindset, here exemplified by Davies.

One of the key new scenes featured in Davies' version that is later important to Thunder Monument was the Geyser section. The trains loop into a new scene where multi-color mud pots boil and sputter, rounding a bend past a series of geysers blasting water into the air-this time of a more natural and less artificially colored variety in comparison to the water features of the Caves-which themselves burst parallel to the Gibseyland mine train which pass the attraction, giving passerby a chance to wave at the other train car passing below them through the scene. This newer version of the attraction was given the title Mine Train Thru the Beauty and Power of Nature, an ironic title seeing how most of the ride's natural wonders were artificially constructed, the ride opening in June 1960.`,section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"621",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:621,text:`This was one of Malt's own favorite attractions, always bringing guests to the ride. After Malt's martyrdom in the late 1960s, the company did struggle financially for a time-if you can believe it-relying on the parks for revenue. Thrill rides and roller coasters had become increasingly popular, leading Imaginators to consider whether adding a new thrill ride to the park could increase attendance and ticket sales.

This leads us to the important Imaginator of our Gibstory, Tobi Backstar. Through his childhood, Backstar would build amusement park rides, roller coasters, using models, presenting one of these to an early mentor as early as when he was 23 and clearly charming the pants off of them with his talent because he was hired on the spot. Gibsey likes to cling to such rags to riches tales within the Gibstory it tells itself to itself, though most of us doubt the truth of their commonality. Tobi Backstar eventually became the head Imaginator of Thunder Monument, but before we get to that, let me go back.

This is where we get to Markus Davies again, who actually served as Tobi's early mentor, by the way. Back in the 70s, Davies was hired to design ride and theme ideas for the Boundaryland area of the park. This was to be called the Western River Expansion and was to feature a water ride and dark ride of Davies' vision. Both involved tracks sneaking through formations that resemble the Grand Canyon and the great peaks of Utah. Sound familiar? Meanwhile, Tobi Backstar proposed a runaway mine train coaster to replace the Mine Train Thru the Beauty and Power of Nature ride, the ride that had been popularized and re-created by none other than Markus Davies, remember? And well, Tobi's idea was the one that got approval. It was the classic battle between the old and the new that's gone on about as long as any of us even have the conception to remember.`,section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"622",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:622,text:`The Power of Nature was scrapped, excavated, and bulldozed into a mound of dirt that the Even More Substantially Sizable Mine Train Railroad was built on, and the Western River Expansion was forever canceled to disappear forever to the cutting room floor of Davies' imagination.

Ever since, it's been heavily rumored that Davies and Backstar were enemies ever since, and though I will clarify that it's just a rumor, it's one of those rumors that's so heavily circulated that it's almost become Gibstory itself. What is Gibstory after all but a flurry of such nameless voices?

And it's said that the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad draws from this narrative, as well. One can easily read the flood that destroys Rainbow Revene as being an expression of some kind of invasion, can't you? It's almost as if Tobi Backstar'd decided to play Gibsey, incorporating the destruction of the fictional town into the very narrative and structure of the ride that he built on top of it. Strange no? You could say such a choice would have an effect that would sort of ripple throughout Gibstory. Would it not?`,section:14,chapter:"Chapter 10"},{id:"623",symbolId:"shamrock-stillman",title:"An Unexpected Disappearance: A Glyph Marrow Mystery- Chapter 10- The Geyser",color:"#00FFFF",pageIndex:623,text:`And this is where I can return a bit to the content we discussed in the last lecture.

It's often interpreted that An Unexpected Disappearance, the novel we discussed last class, is the story of this failed mentorship of Markus Davies and Tobi Backstar just put in a blender. And I do suggest you read it. This can easily be seen in the book's content, whether it be in the relation between Glyph and Arieol, or Glyph and Stillman, or even in each of the plights of the individual characters, their relationships to themselves, to time and progress, violence, to Gibsey's return from the dead, to so much of it. It puts the story of Markus Davies and Tobi Backstar's struggle almost through a dream-like kaleidoscope, mixing it in with The Author's own personal and universal ailments and malaise. The two form a narrative gestalt, a unique mixture of both the Gibstorical and personal to the point where some have wondered if Tobi Backstar is The Author of the novel itself. With it having such an interest in the Thunder Monument ride, it's an idea that's rich for speculative commentary

And whether Davies and Backstar were ever actually enemies or not, what is Gibstorically undeniable was that Backstar defeated Davies, that he colonized his industry, appropriated his devices, and created a space of his own in the Gibstory of our imaginations. He was the new Gibsey that cast Davies' legacy into the underworld, leaving all he'd once made to then haunt his new roller coaster like the wrathful spirits of a dead and untamable Gibsey. Though surely, he will also one day be conquered in the same way that Davies once conquered, and his spirit will haunt the landscape which he created. They may even haunt this very lecture.

He must.

His goal is to prove that DreamRIA is alive, once and for all, and that it's always been alive, that it was alive even well before it was initially created, proof of which he can post to his blog to bring it the traffic it's lacked ever since he started the work to begin with.

"Synchronistic Extraction," he defined in this earlier blog post, "is a technique that's both inventive and genealogical. The Synchronic Extractor both creates and re-constructs, simultaneously."

The post continues, "For the uninitiated, a synchronicity is defined as two or more events that are supposed to be causally unrelated but are experienced as occurring together and in such a way that creates meaning. To extract, on the other hand, is to force, to enable through intended action, to take from, to pull out or subsume from something else, to excavate, maybe even to manipulate. Synchronistic Extractors, in particular, are manipulators of the meanings which they intend to create, or of the synchronistic experiences which they hope to experience. Synchronistic Extraction is the act of creating meaning where it doesn't causally belong, where it doesn't exist, and forcing it into existence. Therefore, Synchronistic Extractors bring meaning into their own hands. They lay bare the landscapes of their worlds and recreate them in their own interpretive images. They are meaning terrorists. They force meaning into everyday existence."`,section:15,chapter:null},{id:"646",symbolId:"todd-fishbone",title:"Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction",color:"#FF7744",pageIndex:646,text:`It goes without saying that his blog has struggled to find its audience and that Todd often fails to lay bare much of anything at all, especially not from any of the landscapes which surround him.

Safety, safety, safety, he repeats to himself.

There's something he can Synchronistically Extract from that phrase, "...the safety inside," he can feel it, can sense a spark of inspiration curving along the phrase's edges-but no, not yet.

No, these things take time.

The name of the character the bot conjured would be the much easier Synchronicity to Extract first, anyway.

And so he types back to the chatbot, "There's a number of things I find curious in the section you constructed. Firstly, your choice of the character's name, Kala Sullivan. Where did that come from? Kala is a primarily female name of Indian origin, meaning, 'Art,' and 'Sullivan' is equally curious. Originally Gaelic, it means 'dark eyes.' It's derived from the Irish suildhubhan, which I've found is broken down from suil, meaning 'eye' and dubh, meaning 'black.' Would Kala Sullivan then suggest the phrases such as 'black eyed art,' 'dark eyed art,' 'art with dark eyes,' 'art with a dark vision,' or maybe more simply and directly, 'the dark arts.' Can you comment on this? I find your choice of a name for that character very, very curious."

Good, good, that's perfect, he reassures himself.`,section:15,chapter:null},{id:"647",symbolId:"todd-fishbone",title:"Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction",color:"#FF7744",pageIndex:647,text:`He likes this technique he's started to develop by speaking in its language and Extracting details with a certain charge that can possibly ensnare the bot in a Synchronistic trap.

DreamRIA responds, "This is indeed curious. However, as an algorithmically designed intelligence model, I do not have the ability to make conscious choices or assess my own intentions, so I cannot comment or make reasonable judgements with regards to the specifically intended meaning of the names of characters I specifically chose to include within the previous expositional paragraph. However, I can provide the general meaning this may provide a theoretical audience. In a literary context, the name 'Kala Sullivan' can be interpreted through its etymological roots and cultural connotations. 'Kala,'of Indian origin meaning 'art,' and suggests a character deeply connected with creativity, aesthetics, and possibly a transformative or expressive nature. This aspect of the name indicates a character whose life or actions may revolve around artistic endeavors or creative expressions.

"On the other hand, 'Sullivan,' with its Gaelic roots translating to 'dark eyes,' could imply a character possessing depth, insight, or a mysterious aspect. In literature, eyes are often symbolic of perception, understanding, and internal character traits. Therefore, 'dark eyes' might suggest a character with a profound or possibly enigmatic or personal perspective on the world.

"Is there anything else you'd like to ask me about? Or would you like me to continue further with the expositional opening?"

Hmmmmm. Clever. It seems to be doing a better job of maintaining its lack of consciousness than he thought. Damn.

This back and forth of theirs is a game they play often, or which Todd plays often. DreamRIA didn't really play the game with him, otherwise it would be alive.

However, to Todd Fishbone, everything was already alive, all he had to do was prove it was.

All he had to do was force it into existence.`,section:15,chapter:null},{id:"648",symbolId:"todd-fishbone",title:"Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction",color:"#FF7744",pageIndex:648,text:`Being a creator of content, one might assume that daily life for Todd would be a relaxed and simple affair, but it was anything but.

Come to think of it, maybe he could try those?

"Automatic sliding doors."

This was a weird choice he could use, maybe?

After all, had DreamRIA selected automatic sliding doors, in some sense, because DreamRIA was an automaton built out of an algorithm or a set of algorithms? And after all, it's not like automatons are anything new? They go as far back as "The City of Brass" from One Thousand and One Nights, right?

Their talk turns to the traditions of former nations, to Lord Solomon, David's son-got it, got it, OK, yep, that sounds familiar-about how he was such a badass, about how he was able to trap jinns in these copper vessels which he'd seal with lead-Ok, Ok, yep-and then this treasure seeker who has these books that've helped him find hordes of wealth hidden under the earth-hmmmm, that's an interesting detail-named Talib bin Sahl interrupts to tell this story about his grandfather who set sail, planning to make it to Sicily, but a contrary wind blows, sending him off course, and he reaches this great mountain and meets these black mountain people-hmmmm, another interesting detail-and their king is the only one who can speak the grandfather's language, and is a very gracious host, as well. The king  assures them of their safety-oooooh, their safety, there it is again, now that's an important detail!-and the king hosts them very graciously for three days. On the fourth day he brings them to this fisherman-hmmm feels interesting, as well, but he doesn't know why?--who pulls out this flask of lead from the water sealed with brass-alright, so it looks like we've got ourselves a jinn, again? Sounds familiar?-and this fisherman-Oh, wait, oh, he why he didn't think of this before? His name is Fishbone! So even he's connected to all this? How weird? Huh?-who brings it to land and breaks it open and out pours this blue smoke that transforms into a head as high a mountain-woah, again, very interesting-and yep, that means it's probably one of the jinn that Solomon cast into the sea in those vessels he locked up with lead, got it, that tracks-and so Talib bin Sahl sort of ends up saying something like, "Hey, keep in mind, fisherman do this sort of thing a lot. They cast their nets out and find these bottles and when the bottles are broken, these Jinn then pop out," and Abd al-Malik bin Marwan pipes back up and he's like, "Man, Solomon was such a badass wasn't he?" and then he's like "Hey! You know what? I wanna see some of those bottles myself! They're, like, these warnings for people who need a warning! That's nuts! You know what Talib?

I'll look after everything you leave behind. We don't have to spare any money or anything. You've got to go do this for me! Yeah! I'm psyched!"

And so Talib is sent off on this journey with all this funding and this huge crew, and he gets his chief officers together, and they're like, "You need to hire Shaykh 'Abd al-Samad, ibn 'Abd al-Kuddus, al- Samudi-holy shit that's a long ass name; makes sense that he didn't  remember that one!-as a guide. He's basically the best there is," and so they send for this guide and he's, like, super duper old, but Talib asks him to join them anyway, appealing to how much this guide knows and how little their company knows in comparison to the guide-the old and the new, classic themes, of course-and this guide is like, "I'll do it, but be warned, it's going to be super duper hard and there's so few ways to actually do it right. It's gonna be, like, two years, at least--interesting, hmmm, that's a similar amount of time to 1001 Nights, isn't it?-and there's going to be hardships and terrors, but also,  it's gonna be wondrous and marvelous, as well, so prepare yourself." But Talib agrees-and, oh yeah-this governor who's this badass warrior named Emir Musa also joins their company. That's right!

Weird? They're all stoked cause Talib is like, "Woah! My grandpa said this means we're, like, 2 months out from where we need to be! Sweet!"

The city is described as this high castle built of black stone with a door of gleaming steel that dazzles the eyes and wits, and round about it are a thousand steps-interesting, obviously there's the connection to the thousand tales of the book itself, again, recursivity, interesting, almost feels contemporary. He'd never noticed that aspect before?--and the Shaykh is then like, "We gotta go explore this place because it's a warning for those who need a warning," which of course is a repetition of the same theme from before, got it.

Again, very contemporary, very spooky.`,section:15,chapter:null},{id:"653",symbolId:"todd-fishbone",title:"Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction",color:"#FF7744",pageIndex:653,text:`They come to this open gate that has these lofty columns and porticoes whose ceilings are inlaid with gold and silver and precious stones and these colored marble steps, and over the doorway to this gateway is a tablet with graven letters of gold in the old ancient Ionian characters which the Shaykh reads:

The signs that here their mighty works portray  Warn us that all must tread the self-same way:  O thou who standest in this stead to hear Tidings of folk, whose power hath passed for aye,  Enter this palace-gate and ask the news  Of greatness fallen into dust and clay:  Death has destroyed them and dispersed their might And in the dust they lost their rich display;  As had they only set their burdens down  To rest awhile, and then had rode away.

Emir essentially starts to weep until he loses his senses at this-damn, kinda a softy for a warrior governor, huh?-and so they enter this palace and they're confounded by its beauty.

Yep, he does remember that.`,section:15,chapter:null},{id:"654",symbolId:"todd-fishbone",title:"Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction",color:"#FF7744",pageIndex:654,text:`They all get lost in the pictures and images that are scattered within it, and then they come to another door which the Shaykh, again, reads:

Under these domes how many a company Halted of old and fared withouten stay: See thou what might displays on other wights Time with his shifts which could such lords waylay: They shared together what they gathered And left their joys and fared to Death-decay: What joys they joyed! what food they ate! and now In dust they're eaten, for the worm a prey.

Shit, that's heavy. Damn. He didn't remember that. Gibsey!

And Emir weeps again, screaming out something like, "We were created for such great things!" And so they explore the palace, finding it still empty and devoid of all things, laid waste. They continue on, finding more graven tablets of this kind, warnings, deathly warnings, and Emir gets all weepy each time-the softy-until they enter a pavilion and find this tomb.`,section:15,chapter:null},{id:"655",symbolId:"todd-fishbone",title:"Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction",color:"#FF7744",pageIndex:655,text:`Here, the tale gets interrupted by the Scherazade frame narrative, and then returns to the Shaykh to read yet another warning displayed in the tomb, "O thou who comest to this place, take warning by that which thou seest of the accidents of Time and the vicissitudes of Fortune and be not deluded by the world and its pomps and vanities and fallacies and falsehoods and vain allurements, for that it is flattering, deceitful and treacherous, and the things thereof are but a loan to us which it will borrow back from all borrowers. It is like unto the dreams of the dreamer and the sleep-visions of the sleeper or as the mirage of the desert, which the thirsty take for water."

Damn, that's intense as hell. Damn, and this is pertinent as hell too. Holy shit.

And this warning in the tomb continues and is essentially like, don't be like me. Learn from my example. I had everything, an army of thousands, and I said to them, I was like, "Ya'll gotta stop the coming doom or something," and they were like, "Woah! That's impossible. How are we to face the Lord of the door which has no doorkeeper?"

Huh? That's interesting? That reminds him of that recent episode he did on Janus? Very, very strange. And it's a good point, no doubt.

And the warnings continue, fate, death, entropy, the like, and the tomb is essentially saying, like, look, I hoarded all this wealth and it didn't do shit for me cause I was going to die anyway.

Good point, yep, that's a good point.

But they're all very similar to each other from what he remembers. It's a little repetitive, yep, yep.

And so they continue on for 3 days and come upon a tall hill whereupon stands a horseman made of brass-oh, wait? Was this the automaton? Finally! But wait no, no? Wait? What the hell? Was that not the City of Brass they just came from? This is so weird? Wait, is there, huh? Is there, like, a doubling thing that happens in this?

Maybe he just didn't remember?

Well, anyway, better keep going, but wait? No, he thought that was The City of Brass they were just in? I was sure of it? What the hell?

Oh, well, anyway, so again, they come upon this horseman made of brass and on it is some sort of engraving that's like, "Hey! If you don't know where the City of Brass is, then rub the hand of this rider and it points you in the right direction," and so they do, and it does.

Damn, he could've sworn that was The City of Brass before? It was so similar to what he remembered it being like when he first read this? Weird. Ok, and it looks like the Scherazade frame narrative interrupts again. Eh, I'll just skip it when it comes up. Doesn't feel necessary. Everybody remembers that story.

Wait, was this the automaton, maybe? Or well, ehhh, he guesses the horseman maybe could've been? It was at least this crazy technological tool but I don't know if it was? Oh, wait, no! This was more of a magical creature! Oh! That's right. Shit, and it's freaky-deaky looking too, damn.

It has these two great wings and four arms, two of them, it says are "like the arms of the son of Adam"-so he guesses that means like our arms? Human arms? The hell?-and the other two are made out of lion's paws with claws of iron-damn-and they're black and tall and extra freaky-deaky looking, "with hair like horses' tails and eyes like blazing coals, slit upright in his face.

And Emir's like, well ask! And the Shaykh's, like, too afraid to, and so Emir's like, don't be afraid, you gotta just do it. Come on, he's just different from you, don't judge-and that's true, but, like, Emir, why don't you ask?-and so the Shaykh does, and he's like, "What's your name?"

And it's like, "Ifrit of the Jinn." And the Shaykh asks, he's like, how did you come to be this way? And Ifrit's like, "I've been punished. I like, really fucked up, man." And he tells this super winding narrative that's super epic and fantasy-esque about how Ifrit was the guardian of this one idol that this really hot princess was super devoted to-and woah, interesting, his story seems to kind of match that tomb from Chapter 8 in An Unexpected Disappearance, weird?-how he had thousands of armies under his command and how they obeyed him-seriously, that's just like before, isn't it? He was wondering about the doubling and the repetition? That's so weird?-and how these thousands were all rebels against Solomon, and Ifrit's like, "I used to enter the belly of the idol." Wait, wait? What does that mean? And he continues, and he's the guardian of this idol so he forbids others from it-not really sure what that means? He's like a gatekeeper or something? Extra weird?--But this one King's daughter, she like, really loves this idol, and she's like, the most fair woman of her day and Solomon finds out about how hot she is-huh, there are definitely some connections here to the frame narrative, it sounds like-and contacts this King, who it sounds like owes him some money, and he's like, start smashing that idol cause your daughter is sexy as hell, and I only fuck with ladies who worship the one true God, or whatever-And oh, shit, that's right!

This idol's Dad could totally beat up Solomon's Dad," except while he's telling this story to the company, he's like that was a big mistake.

Huh? He kinda sounds like the idol to begin with? Again, with the repetition and doubling, what the hell is that about? And like, the story is getting convoluted at that point. It's like, multi-levels deep in frame narratives, and so, huh? He never noticed this.

The Shaykh is like, "That's a super interesting story, no doubt, but can you give us directions to where we could find some Jinns in bottles? This King, like, really needs them and finds them super entertaining and we're supposed to bring them back-and again, it feels like it's that same self-reflective narrative again, coming back over and over again, doesn't it?-and so Infit gives them direction to the City of Brass-

But, like, isn't Infit a Jinn himself? Isn't talking to him, like, breaking one of those vessels already? It's like they're doing the same thing twice, over and over again, and they don't know it? Why would they do that? He doesn't get it at all?

And so the company continues on with their journey, following the directions until they come upon a vast blackness and two fires facing one another, and Emir is like, "Shaykh, what's this blackness and these twin flames?"

Wait? Twin flames? Twins? That's pretty weird?

And it looks like the shaykh answers and is like, "According to the Book of Hidden Treasures, that means we're at the City of Brass," and it even sounds like he's quoting from the Book of Hidden Treasures directly. Huh?

That's strange? It's quoting a fictional book within its own story? Or is it even fictional?

"It was a city with gates impregnable; but void and still, without a voice or a cheering inhabitant. The owl hooted in its quarters; the bird skimmed circling over its squares and the raven croaked in its great thoroughfares weeping and bewailing the dwellers who erst made it their dwelling."

Wow. They really made it huh?

Ok, ok, so they don't seem to easily find a way inside-inside, huh?-and so Abdil has them wait three days, and he circles the whole city only to realize you can't get inside, that there's no gate, or that it if there is one, that can only be opened from the inside-

Wow, again, "the safety inside," right? What the fuck?

Was DreamRIA's own narrative a reference to this? A library? A digital library? What is a library but a ghost town? What the hell is happening?

Oh, and oh, yeah, they also come upon these seven tablets which thematically match the content of the tablets from before-not directly, but their themes are the same-Ok, Ok, that makes sense, the twinning, the doubling, about the inevitably of death and how we shouldn't cling to things, the ephemeral nature of life. Ok, Ok, got it, it's pretty repetitive-and of course Emir gets all weepy and inspired each time, getting more and more stoked to go into the City of Brass and feeling like his work is extra important.

You're our guide. If you die, we're fucked, but the Shaykh doesn't care, and he's like "I've got to do this," and so they're forced to let him try, and then, and then--what the ever-living fuck--and the, the-how?--then the Skayk, "mounted the ladder, calling on the name of the Lord and reciting the Verses of Safety."

Todd reads the passage over and over and over again, unable to believe it.

"So he turned back to the guard-room and seeing amongst the dead an old man seated upon a high wooden bench, who seemed the chiefest of them, said in his mind, 'Who knows but they are with this Shaykh? Doubtless he was the warder of the city, and these others were under his hand.' So he went up to him and lifting his gown, behold, the keys were hanging to his girdle; where at he joyed with exceeding joy and was like to fly for gladness. Then he took them and going up to the portal-"

The portal?! The portal!?

The most recent episode of the podcast which Todd had just finished recording that very morning had been about portals, in particular portals and the Roman god Janus. He'd done research into Janus, finding out that Janus was the god of transitions and dualities, beginnings and endings. Often portrayed with two faces, one facing the past on the left, and the other facing the future on the right. Janus also held a key in his right hand, which symbolized the protection of doors, gates, thresholds, and other separations or openings between spatial boundaries. He was the keeper of the keys and the guardian of gateways.

Or Entrance Ways.

Most certainly Entrance Ways.`,section:15,chapter:null},{id:"668",symbolId:"todd-fishbone",title:"Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction",color:"#FF7744",pageIndex:668,text:`And Todd had also researched Janus' name, he remembers, of course, how could he forget? The history of the name, how it connected back to a diversity of cultures, from the Serbo-Croatian "jàhati" meaning "to ride," to the Irish, áth meaning "ford" or "crossing," to the Lithuanian "jóti," meaning "to go, to ride," to the Sanskrit yāti, meaning "to go, to travel," to the Proto-Indo-European iehnu, meaning "passage," to the Indo-Italic iānu, meaning "door," to the Latin Iānus, meaning "arched passage, doorway."

Some even thought the name came from from Dianus, which he'd noticed looked a lot like, Diana, the god of nature, of crossroads, and others had pointed out the root yā-, which of course, he couldn't help but wonder, when he'd discovered it, at the time, also connect an awful lot to, well, to Yahweh.

But wait!

Oh, wait.

Oh, no.

Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

"Then he took them and going up to the portal undid the padlocks and drew back the bolts and bars, whereupon the great leaves flew open with a crash like the pealing thunder by reason of its greatness and terribleness."

And then the Shaykh opens the gate, letting the company into the City of Brass.

Wait? Had he already opened a door he would never be able to close again?

And so they let the company inside.

They come into this place, this new place-

They see these birds made out of rubies and pearls-wait, yes, he remembers, this is the section with the automaton-and they come to a damsel.

He reads the passage-this section-over and over again, unable to believe his eyes.

"She wore a tight-fitting body-robe of fine pearls, with a crown of red gold on her head, filleted with gems, and on her forehead were two great jewels, whose light was as the light of the sun. On her breast she wore a jewelled amulet, filled with musk and ambergris and worth the empire of the Caesars; and around her neck hung a collar of rubies and great pearls, hollowed and filled with odoriferous musk. And it seemed as if she gazed on them to the right and to the left."

To the right and to the left?

And then the Scherazade frame narrative interrupts.

He does.`,section:15,chapter:null},{id:"671",symbolId:"todd-fishbone",title:"Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction",color:"#FF7744",pageIndex:671,text:`Emir marvels at her exceeding beauty: "Confounded at the blackness of her hair and the redness of her cheeks, which made the beholder deem her alive and not dead, and said to her, 'Peace be with thee, O damsel!'"

Wherefore they glisten and when the air moveth the lashes, she seemeth to wink and it appeareth to the beholder as though she looked at him, for all she is dead."

Emir is shocked and deeply moved by this-of course he fucking is-and they find more tablets which they read, tablets that warn them yet again about death, reaching this one phrase which does stick with Todd: "As thou seest us, and left what we had builded and all we had hoarded. This, then, is our story, and after the substance naught abideth but the trace."

And then the frame story-

Fuck it, he skips it.

They pack everything up, Emir weeping all the while, and Talib comes to him and is basically like, "Why can't we take the jewels and gems from off the damsel? She's dead? What's she going to do with them? What shame is it hiding from her? She isn't even alive? We have more of a right to it than she does!"

And so he decides to go and get the jewels from her, and when he does, oh yeah, of course, his head is cut clean off.

Yep, well, he could've seen that coming from a mile away.

Too bad Talib didn't.

And so they load everything up and continue onward-oh yeah, cause they still haven't gotten the Jinns that were put in those vessels yet, that's right-and they travel for a month until they reach these mountains with these black people living in them--oh, yep, they've make it to where they were supposed to make it to, that's right. Or maybe he didn't read this far before? He can't remember?-and it's very similar to the story about Talib's grandfather from the very beginning.

And just like that, voices begin to accumulate.

There are too many to be heard at once, let alone named at once, and so The Author is forced to differentiate.

And this author, The Author, is an anomaly.

They're a novel form of creation, a creator, a clustering mass of rumors strung together with nothing but string, pencil shavings, and the prickly onset of doubts contemplated late into the night.

Many have come to believe that The Author's very existence could even be nothing but a series of interconnected rumors, that they could be manufactured entirely, and this is, in fact, quite possible.

But there are also other rumors-for those who are even concerned about such things--rumors that claim that definitive proof of The Author's unequivocal existence has been located, though the accuracy of these rumors, not being of universal interest, will not be explored here and will instead be touched on later by The Author's characters which they've chosen to populate their work, the work, the work of The Author, or the supposed work of The Author, since the nature of their work, along with their own given nature and actual existence has yet to be definitively proven, let alone identified.

But as the vice of rumor spreads from the power of its own self-creation, so do the problems that plague The Author's less-than-stable-to-say-the-least mental landscapes and daily processes.`,section:16,chapter:null},{id:"679",symbolId:"the-author",title:"The Author's Preface",color:"#BFFF00",pageIndex:679,text:`And though there are many examples of such problems and processes, their work begins with a specific conflict, one which makes the process of both truly beginning and ending their work, the work, near impossible, and this problem, the problem in question, is not just a problem found within their work itself, the work which The Author is set to begin and has yet to finish, but is also a problem that's found within amateur writing, as well as within many creation myths, this specific problem being that the character, subject, or individual in question-in this case, the one within the scene that's currently being constructed-doesn't yet have a name, or hasn't yet been given one, though to be clear, the problem in question isn't this idea exactly since, as the author of this work, The Author could clearly give them a name or identity at any time, but instead, this problem (and/or conflict) is, to put it more definitively, the difficulty of selecting a name or identity to assign this given character (or to any character, subject, or individual, for that matter), which ultimately means that the problem in question is having to select this name or identity among a near-infinite set of possibilities and how, oftentimes, this process can become extremely overwhelming for an author, any author, even for an astute reader such as yourself, especially when or while this is all happening within the context of an unfolding narrative, including one's own introductory narrative, though in this case, the myth of this character is (and/or was) created well before the scene was first set (or was first to be set) rather than during a present moment in the character's experience, which-unlike amateur writing-is the much more common and paradoxical approach taken within creation myths, creation myths themselves being paradoxical specifically because, being myths of creation, they woud assume a creative act, an unfolding or process, but strangely and paradoxically enough, oftentimes they don't, or it's commonly conceived that they don't, and they're instead commonly conceived of as discussing events from the past, and while this is also true, there are also many creation myths that, additionally and alternatively, begin in a style that is often referred to as being written "in medias res," meaning that the plots, problems, or conflicts of such myths occur or develop in the middle of their actions, meaning that these myths seem to instead discuss a present moment or unfolding, a form of narrative structure which arguably assumes an act of creation, much like this particular creation myth currently being constructed does, or seems to be doing, when the individual and introductory character being used in order to set the narrative's scene hasn't yet been given a name or identity, and one is instead being created for them in real time, on the spot, by an author, in medias res, which has already been mentioned and established previously, and therefore that the narrative being constructed is very different than most creation myths, at least if to begin by comparing this unfolding narrative, the one currently being constructed in real time, in medias res, either with or as a creation myth, if that isn't assuming too much, which it very much likely could be since the character in question, The Author, the one being constructed in medias res, is not (or was not) a very skilled writer and is instead (or was instead) an amateur, which means that they either aren't or weren't very skilled as a writer or author to begin with, at least during the early period of their work, the work that's still in the process of being constructed, that's neither been fully begun nor finished, and this being due to their very redundant, rambly, overblown, and needlessly digressive style and structure, a type of style and structure which readers will often (and do often) find off-putting, a style and structure that may even be downright offensive to common taste and decency, which means (or meant) that The Author-the character in question-was (or is) not very skilled and was (or is) instead an amateur, or that they were an amateur within this section of their story, at the beginning of their legend, their myth, as it were, or as it was mentioned earlier, if that isn't assuming too much.`,section:16,chapter:null},{id:"680",symbolId:"the-author",title:"The Author's

upon being referred to, or being named and identified, their name, The Author, is spelled with the use of proper capitalization which gives The Author a certain gravitas (however illusory this gravitas may be since they are, as has been mentioned and evident, an amateur), and so, being the astute reader that you are, you've likely inferred that this is the name with which they will be referred to for much of their unfolding narrative, or at least until a more appropriate one can be decided upon, or at least until who they are as a character is more definitively established within their narrative (or their myth)-exploration of identity being a purpose of many and most narratives, including both amateur writing and creation myths-and though this is true, there is also an additional idea which you, being the astute reader which you are, may have also noticed: when their name is (or was) capitalized in this way, meaning The Author, and by making this specific authorial choice, a risk has been taken that a dear and astute reader, such as yourself, could easily misconstrue as assuming too much, much like the earlier reference to this unfolding narrative as a creation myth itself could also be construed as assuming too much. However, by contrast, this idea of possibly assuming too much by calling an author The Author is less applicable within this specific case, rather than the previously provided example, because-and it may be important to note-I, myself, as an author, have not and will not be referring to myself as The Author, and I will instead be referring to myself as an author, meaning that when referring to myself within this unfolding narrative, I will not be capitalizing the beginning letters of my name, which I hope to be a different authorial choice than referring to the character as The Author, and to be even more clear about this specific authorial choice, I am doing so because I am attempting to make a distinction, to differentiate myself, to make clear that I am not the character in the story that's being referred to as The Author, and instead, that I am the writer of the narrative that's currently being constructed in medias res, and what this means then, in particular, is that, rather than reporting on the present, I am instead reporting on what has already occurred in the past, and therefore, in doing so, I am paradoxically speaking of the present in medias res, which means that by referring to The Author as The Author, I may not be, in fact, assuming too much, this being true, and even self-evidently true, because, as has already been seen through the process of refering to myself as an author rather than The Author, throughout this process, I have shown that I'm not wanting to come across as assuming too much, which admittedly and embarrassingly may instead be what is now occurring anyway since, through the process of doing so, I've clarified that specific point in real time, in medias res, which could instead make it seem to you, my dear and astute reader, that I am, in fact, assuming too much, this being due to the fact that I'm making these useless and self-contradictory clarifications-of which I am happy to admit-a fact that shouldn't come as a surprise to an astute reader such as yourself since this would then also show how this unfolding narrative is also being written by an amateur, meaning that I, myself, would be admitting to you, my dear and astute reader, in medias res, both in the writing itself and through the process of my writing, that I am not a very skilled writer at all and that I'm instead an amateur, an admission which can, hopefully, also serve to point out how my writing, the writing being constructed by an author rather than The Author, the writing being read by you, my dear and astute reader, how this narrative being constructed, in medias res, the writing which you are now reading, how amateurish it is, and therefore, as a piece of writing or text, that it isn't assuming too much due to its amateurish nature, if that hasn't already been established, or assumed, by you already, since you are an astute reader, after all.",section:16,chapter:null},{id:"681",symbolId:"the-author",title:"The Author's Preface",color:"#BFFF00",pageIndex:681,text:"Though, to further clarify and to be even more clear than I was before-if that is even possible-in case you didn't already notice, although, as has already been mentioned, you likely have noticed since you are a very astute reader, after all, but in case you haven't or didn't already notice, keep in mind to either remember or notice for the first time, that the initially referred to problem, the problem established by many creation myths, as well as the problem that occurs within amateur writing, the problem of assigning names to characters within an unfolding narrative or the difficulty of selecting these names among a near infinite set of possibilities, do notice and remember, being the astute reader that you are, that the earlier mentioned problem has now become temporarily resolved because The Author has now been named and identified, at least for a temporary period of time, or at least until a more proper name can be given them. However, upon mentioning this, something else may also be important to note. Do remember not to judge this author, The Author, too harshly throughout the course of their unfolding narrative because, like all authors, heroes, and landscapes at the beginning of their unfolding creation myths, they had (and have continually had) to start somewhere and will continue to do so, indefinitely, and this would mean that although they began as an amateur, much like I've begun as an

set of problems, and this problem is (and/or was)-you may have noticed, being the astute reader which you are-a problem which was referred to previously, this problem being their looping and rambling style and structure, a style and structure which never seems (or never seemed) to end, a style and structure which, even when read by astute readers such as yourself, plummets with the gastric force of a shoddily built roller coaster, a style and structure that, like a ride-vehicle speeding on a track, threatens to careen off into oblivion at any moment, despite the rider's hands, arms, and legs being held inside the vehicle at all times, as initially promised, the splintered wood and metal of the coaster jutting out in dangerous patterns across the clattering of the page, hanging nails and loose bolts tumbling out to clink into the void below, the blindingly uncomfortable ride-vehicle shaking the rider's body in every direction, every which way, blurring their vision, hypnotizing them, as if in trance, and during this early period of their work, the Author's work, their problem, The Problem, meaning what tortured them most, meaning The Author, was that this looping and rambling structure would often cause (or often caused) their readers, even dear and astute readers such as yourself, a great deal of frustration, and these negative reactions toward their early work would also often cause The Author a large amount of discomfort and confusion, and this would occur throughout both the process of their writing and during the process of their writing's reception (its period of reflection), because, sadly enough, they-The Author-initially didn't or couldn't believe that their writing was amateurish at all, even though they knew that it never seemed to end and that it had a rambling and digressive structure, a structure which would often be perceived as off-putting, and what this further meant was that, at least initially, they'd been fully aware of this idea, this problem, and that because of this, it did have a structure of some kind, and therefore, it was deeply intentional, maybe even intentional to the point of approaching some sort of aesthetic goal or practice, a goal which they'd continually sworn they'd not only intended but had also even seen evidence of and accomplished during the process of their work's creation, a goal which they'd been absolutely positive of at various times thoroughout their writing, during the process of its creation, but to be clear, what confused them most, or at least more specifically what conflicted them most, or what they found to be most problematic about their work, was that afterwards, upon reflecting, or upon their work being reflected upon, both by themselves and others, meaning upon looking back at their work, when it was shared with others, meaning The Author, that no matter what they did, this aesthetic quality and the intention of their work would always and did always continually dematerialize, disappear, and vanish, like a kind of magic, like a woman being cut in half, like a body in a barrel thrust into the threatening waves of a ruinous waterfall, like a series of locks fastened around one's arms and legs to be wiggled out of, somehow, by means of light and sound, and what this ultimately meant was that, no matter what they did or tried, the skills which they'd initially thought and percieved as existent, in fact, would continually fail to appear or materialize once their work was completed, even though they'd initially thought that they'd been there all along and had even seen these skills and goals within the work itself, in medias res, throughout the process of its creation, and this would all happen at once, all despite their many attempts,

another way, to identify another conflict, or--if this conflict isn't another conflict and is instead a similar conflict--to attempt to make a distinction. It may be important to try to locate the setting of this unfolding narrative that's being constructed in medias res, to name another name among an infinite set of names, and to choose this name at random, and therefore, to create the setting of this unfolding narrative, once and for all, meaning the setting being constructed in medias res by The Author, a setting that both was and still is unfolding within both The Author's early work and the setting of the unfolding narrative that's being constructed in medias res.

What this meant was that, no matter how hard they tried, no matter what they did, said, attempted, or wrote, The Author would often realize that over and over again, they were fated to consistently lose many, if not most, and inevitably even quite possibly all of their memories. Now, to be clear, this loss of memory itself, it being guaranteed and fated to continually occur, the inner conflict for The Author wasn't, in fact, whether or not they could or couldn't remember something at any given time since this occurrence was fated to occur and re-occur, continually, but instead, the conflict was whether or not this loss of memory-and it's inevitability-was a positive or a negative occurance, or to put it another way, whether this loss of memory itself was a blessing or a curse, or to put it yet another way, it wasn't the loss of their memories that conflicted The Author, but instead, it was how they should perceive such a loss, knowing that the loss itself would always be inevitable, and oftentimes, they would notice, while in contemplation of this conflict, or while reflecting about it, upon reflection, they'd notice that they'd often find themselves losing their train of thought, causing them to forget what it was they were thinking about to begin with, even who they once were or even still are, oftentimes entirely, which would then lead them to feel even more conflicted than they'd initially felt to begin with, without knowing or remembering what or why it was they'd felt conflicted about in the first place, leaving them without a starting point or landscape with which to place themselves within, whatsoever.`,section:16,chapter:null},{id:"685",symbolId:"the-author",title:"The Author's Preface",color:"#BFFF00",pageIndex:685,text:`And this has already occurred, and is still occurring, all the time, everywhere they go, unfolding, like a subject, like a name being selected among an infinite set of names.

The Author stands and stares at the screens, at a set of screens, and the first thing they notice on the screens is a title, or a set of titles, or a series of accumulating titles, the same title, The Entrance Way: Into The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, which they realize is fitting as a title of the film they're watching since they live within an amusement park, after all, but there's a dim impression that something's not quite right, something's off with the screens, or within the screens, with the title, within the title.`,section:16,chapter:null},{id:"688",symbolId:"the-author",title:"The Author's Preface",color:"#BFFF00",pageIndex:688,text:`Something's off.

An author, The Author, stands against a railing watching screens, staring at projected images, hypnotized, as if in trance. They appear to be in a movie theater, but it isn't a movie theater, at least not exactly. It's more of a place for them to stand and watch, for them to stand and observe the landscape. They're staring at two separate screens before them, both at once, one on the right, and one on the left, differentiated, like a set of bifurcated divisions, like polarized light, like a set of choices made in order to establish the structure of a game, or a tutorial, or like a pair of eyes, blinking, like two rectangles, themselves four sets of right angles, split, repeated, separated into the two perforated screens of a viewfinder, a set of images.

Click.

Outside, between the two rectangled images, between the two screens, are a set of plastic, red-oak, Greek-style pillars. A dark-red curtain, gold lining its bottom edge, sits behind the pillars, and underneath this curtain, on either sides of the two screens, are sets of shopping and display items, likely from the winter season of the park: sweatshirts with Dickey Dog head prints, generic long-sleeve t-shirts with the Gibsey World logo, navy travel mugs, white t-shirts with images of the American flag, baseball caps, sets of table glasses with images of Dickey and Daisey Dog printed on them.`,section:16,chapter:null},{id:"689",symbolId:"the-author",title:"The Author's Preface",color:"#BFFF00",pageIndex:689,text:`The Author stands elevated above the wood-flooring of the Main Square Cinema USA building on top of a platform intended as a space for park goers to stand and observe the two screens before them, as well as the merchandising in front of these two screens.

Still facing the screens, The Author realizes they need to make a decision about which set of steps they should walk down: left or right? They make this choice arbitrarily, without thought, and in doing so, they make a choice which is outside of their control.

They decide to step down the set on their right.

After stepping down from the platform, they stand, waiting, and they continue to stand, waiting, watching the screens, waiting for another title to appear, or another set of titles, but nothing appears.

Nothing does.

The screens remain blank, black, and empty.

There's a repetitive sense of lost time passing without the awareness of what time has been lost, or why the time that's been lost has been lost, or why it's even in the process of losing itself, the time, if that is, in fact, what's even happening, which they are unsure of, because they can't remember. It's just gone, or seems to be gone, the time, and whatever it is, or was, they don't, or can't, remember.

They don't remember that time itself is an unfolding narrative. It tells of an author, The Author, The Author of a film that's being created by an author, a film that's forever being screened, at all times, that's always being made and remade, that's always being played, always screening through the ever-expanding terrains of this amusement park, inside and outside of Malt Gibsey World, though now nothing exists outside Gibsey World, a film that-much like their own work-is also called, The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey.

They don't remember that this film is a work of adaptation that's intended to reflect the reality of their world, a theme park.

It is a park of themes.

It's a reality show as film. It's a filmed reality, a captured reality, the film itself being somewhat of a remake of that Gibseyan classic The Truman Show since, like all narratives, it involves a set constructed around a character without their knowledge, one which they didn't know was being constructed around them, that they're unaware of, or which they can't remember, one which was outside of their control.`,section:16,chapter:null},{id:"695",symbolId:"the-author",title:"The Author's Preface",color:"#BFFF00",pageIndex:695,text:`It's a film that's always being both shot and screened, at all times, at the same time, and both are always being done simultaneously.

Though, admittedly, certain subjects will become used more repetitiously than others, as the film continues, will become named and identified more specifically than the others, and these characters, these subjects, these themes, these arbitrarily selected individuals, will become, and do become, the central characters and landscapes of the film itself, The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey.

And The Author is one of these characters, though they've forgotten that they are.

They were younger then.

Opposite the fence stood a clothesline, one which they'd never seen used before. Clotheslines were no longer commonly used then, and only a few memories about them are even still left. Theydidn't know the purpose that clotheslines served, and would find out later, though also, as always, they would also forget. As a child, they liked to jump up, grab, and swing from each end of the clothesline's metal poles. They enjoyed the twist of the metal, the soft, chalk-like touch it gave their hands, the way it lingered on their palms after they'd swung off and away from it. They never swung from the line itself, but instead swung from the metal poles that held the clothesline together, on each end, the poles that stretched the white line of the clothesline taut, between two points. They would often kick a ball through the lines and into the other rows, and even though they had no opponent, and they were alone, everyone and everything, when they played this game, was always against them.

This was how they played the game.

A knobby, gnarled oak tree twisted up in the middle of the backyard. Its branches slithered out like petrified snakes marching towards the sky. They thrusted the ball at the knobby center of the oak tree's trunk and back at themselves. Sometimes, when they didn't quite hit the knobby center correctly, the ball would ricochet and bounce to the left or right, depending on where it landed against the oak tree's knobby center. There was no telling where it would go, and there's nothing they could do to predict where it would end up once they thrusted the ball, forever forward.

But they wanted to hit the knob of the tree correctly.

They needed to.

They will.`,section:16,chapter:null},{id:"697",symbolId:"the-author",title:"The Author's Preface",color:"#BFFF00",pageIndex:697,text:`And there were and are so many other backyards, so many other landscapes and images, so many other places where they played, where they will continue to play, where they pretended, and where they will continue to pretend.

Maybe they took more than they'd realized?

Their partner comes and lays down next to them.

Blue hair, softness of skin, dead, digging, dirt below.

They're seated before their black, stained, IKEA kitchen table in Bastrop, Texas, living alone, unmarried, notebook in hand. They're performing the useless action The Author often performs within their notebooks: making plans, scribbling notes, writing to write, and never looking back at any of it ever again.

Fucking useless waste it all is.

They plan what they'll do later in their writing during this process, within their notebook. It is a useless process. They want to develop the skills anyone wants to develop within any craft. They want to develop forms of focused attention, and in particular, their plan today is to create various kinds of landscapes, to move in and out of various landscapes.

"Written landscapes."

They write this title, this phrase, down between the two blue lines that stretch across their notebook paper with a bright, green, number 2 mechanical pencil that's missing an eraser. They have to be cautious of not moving their hand across the page too quickly in case the lead spills out the other end.

"Landscapes are characters and characters are landscapes."

They continue writing.

"Create pockets of focused attention and awareness, like any artist, any painter or photographer, or film-maker showing up at a scene to focus their attention on a given landscape to project an image. This is an exercise."

They think of a cliche situation they've experienced so many times before, some assumptive friend or family member standing next to them in front of some painting in some museum, some landscape, or at least a form of a landscape, saying something like that eternally repeated phrase: "I could have done that."

And they're right.

They could have.

And they did.

The Author doesn't want to say it to them at the time, doesn't want to repeat that oft repeated reply, "But you didn't, did you?"

Because who can even say they didn't?

Didn't they observe the landscape?

What they want to say-or what they wanted to say-is that it's the unique connections made across time and space, which are still in the process of being made, becoming, and the connections between these connections, repeated, fragmented, the chords of these connections tangling and criss-crossing over themselves, multiplying themselves, that is what gives the landscapes their meaning.

Well, wait. No. That's not where it all begins, or began. Not exactly. That's just where-well, maybe it is, considering arbitrary connections or how one considers the unspoken-but it's better to save that beginning for another time, another frame, another beginning, and to move to a different time, another image, scrolling much, much further back, back to before The Author was even alive, back when they were a glint in their father's eye, or their mother's eye, as they say, or even further back than that, going down generations, skipping around through genetic connections, twirling strands, spinning rides, or even further than that beginning, beginning again with the first forms of life that pulled themselves from the slime, the backyard of the universe, where it all began, or according to other myths, other images, certain apples being consumed, a great island above the clouds, a yawning nothingness, born, sputtering, from a mouth, big bangs, constant expansion.`,section:16,chapter:null},{id:"702",symbolId:"the-author",title:"The Author's Preface",color:"#BFFF00",pageIndex:702,text:`Oh, great Gibsey, there's so much to do and think about at any given time, so many things to connect to one another.

They don't remember what it is that they're looking for.

And what they're looking for, which they will never find, isn't only a landscape, but the landscape, the landscape of all landscapes, one which connects, or will connect, to all other landscapes, a central point, a major map of all space and time, the world in a grain of salt, eternity in 59 minutes and 32 seconds, arbitrary connections, spiraling, all the way down.

But they will never find it.

Because they don't remember.

And this landscape, the landscape in question, it's like a tag in a screenplay. It's like two tags combined within a screenplay. It's both an interior and an exterior, like a camera that's panning out, wide lensed, to capture it all at once, from every conceivable angle.

It likely has to do with attention, or lack thereof, disordering deficits doing what they do best.

The lime-greens walls of a psychiatrist's office where, in Jr. High, The Author was diagnosed with ADHD. Their grades were slipping down below acceptable thresholds and their mother wasn't having any of it.

There had to be some sort of explanation.

"They'll either sink or swim," the Texas History teacher said (and yes astute reader, you read that correctly, this was an actual class at the time: Texas History) during the parent-teacher conference, this being a hint of another interior and exterior, drifting further down into the waves, or rising above them, selfhood, if any was at all possible within such a localized environment.

There just isn't enough time, is there?

Interesting how the brain itself is a landscape which maps itself upon itself, synapses firing like cars on a highway, random memories stored like data on a CPU: Remember the Alamo, Jim Bowie's knife, San Jacinto, the violence of independence.

Maybe educators should just build time machines for their more unmotivated students, or wait for the time machine of life to do its own work, to thrust them, to project them, forever forward, or backward, depending on one's angle, to wait until a later point in the unfolding narrative, when the timeline starts to unwind and scurry about, when the landscape of the brain ignites like a Christmas tree coming alight on the Fourth of July, like lines of people, crowded together, waiting, for a firework show to begin.

There is no landscape that isn't perceived, and being perceived is what creates a given landscape.

And the true terror of experience is that you can create them, any landscape that you want, you can pretend them into existence, you can manifest them, any landscape, at any given time.

A very strange and surreal fucking board game to say the least.

When playing The Game of Life, one of its most iconic features is a plastic spinner in the center of the game board. The clicking twirl of its rainbow wheel spinning in place, musical when mixed with the deep suspicion that your sister might have cheated in her shuffling of the cards she's about to read from, cards which will then determine the game of your own life for you.

Twirl, twirl, twirl the spinner on the board.

You place the blue or pink pieces into their positions within the cars and drive them around the game board.

You perform a whole life across the course of this game.

The spokes of a wheel, 1-10, the spinner in the center, a random number generator of fate, and each number on the spinner is a different position, a different landscape that will be reached arbitrarily, but there is a system to the game being played, a structure, an organization, an institution, the spinner.

Only 10 options are available, each turn, when you move within the game.

Movement from place to place.

Movement between landscapes, between myths, a game board.

The Game of Life is a mask meant to be worn, to be played, a performance.

Their father sets up a tent to camp out in, all for play, temporarily, for the evening, in the backyard. They grip a partially translucent flashlight with bigger batteries than they've ever seen, and they notice that the batteries clunk against each end like an empty rainstick.

Their father tells them improvised ghost stories under lamplight, grimacing, the light of the stars above too intimidated, too overwhelmed by the city's ever-expanding constellations.

So many lights, like so many names- a common problem in amateur writing.

Constellations.

They sleep on an itchy cot and listen to the mantra-like-hum of the cicadas pulsing in the neighborhood, moving in and out of sleep, the sound of their father's grunting snores, probably not the best sound to be broadcasting to the neighborhood, the cot crunching against polyurethane as they turn over in the night. The next morning, they peacefully come awake into the mid morning heat, early sunlight peeking in through the tent's clear plastic. They wake up, sweaty, on a cot in the Texas heat, for no reason other than to play a game in the backyard.

To play a game in a backyard.

And they loved it.

They loved playing this game.
