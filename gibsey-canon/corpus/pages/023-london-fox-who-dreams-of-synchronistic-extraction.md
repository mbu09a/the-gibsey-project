I will remake you.

Enter my kingdom, my magical dominion,

The Magical Dominion.

Enter and become the words which are my self and which are now to become yours.

Enter my words.

My words shall become you.

My words have already become you.

They have become your very flesh.

The shell within which you rest.

The flesh which sits upon the bones that twist beneath your skin.
