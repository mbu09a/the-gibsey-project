"See? You do seem to have changed a bit there, Glyph. You seem a bit more comfortable in your own skin. Though I'm not sure if I agree with The Author's choice to leave that change not witnessed fully by the reader in the last few sections. Feels like some sort of a failure or unexpected disappearance has occurred, like they're hiding something."

"It's a thematic consideration. Gibsey has plenty of characters to pick from, should you need one," Glyph interjects, shrugging their shoulders, their eyes on the clouds above. Stratocumulus. Or maybe Cumulus? Or maybe there's a darker change in the weather? Maybe more Tempestuous clouds are forming, and the sky darkens? Or maybe the types of clouds aren't even named? Maybe they look like different shapes, the clouds, shapes that correspond to the different patterns of this ride, the various artifacts already mentioned, which he's ridden so many times?

He can feel it within himself, how ancient the ride is.

He's a thousand years old.

He's seen billions of clouds move across the screen of the sky.
