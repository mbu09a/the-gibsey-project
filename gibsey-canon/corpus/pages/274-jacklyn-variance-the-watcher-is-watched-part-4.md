Jack Parlance sits at small hotel desk at an Economy Room at The Gibsey Ecco Resort.

Notebook on desk. Lamp on. Likely late evening.

Writing.

He seems unaware that the focus of the film has now moved to him sitting in his hotel room apartment, unless his writing is intentional, which it may actually be. He's a known devotee of the more naturalistic and minimalistic communities dedicated to the ever-screening film, and being a devotee of the film himself, he's bound to find out sooner or later, depending on how long the focus remains on him, that he's now become one of its subjects.

But he may not have time.

The focus of the film is known to shift about incessantly.

But he also may already know the focus is on him, right this very moment.

Either way, his awareness or understanding isn't clear to the viewer.
