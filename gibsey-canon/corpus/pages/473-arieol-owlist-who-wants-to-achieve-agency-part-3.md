But the scene is still unfolding.

Oren still hasn't even responded to Arieol's initial query about using the story Oren was telling about the desert.

In fact, Oren's likely still back there stammering in fury at even being interrupted at all, but as always, there's much more that will come out of this than could be dreamt of in either Oren or Arieol's ever-imaginative philosophies, and such attractions are typically the most popular attractions in the park, like everyone else, they'll have to wait in line, per usual, to see what happens next.

Of course it's been commonly spread around that people of Arieol's ilk were to be organizing to all start cannibalizing their mentors all at once, at some point they would anyway, all of them, together.

Or this was supposedly going to happen, at least.

And not that Arieol doesn't support and hope for such things to take shape, of course, he's hungry as anybody else who's fed scraps always is, but, good Gibsey were they going to need some luck with that most (un)holy of ambitious operations!

When one is forced to escape being eaten on such a regular basis, there isn't quite time to plan any kind of four-course-meals for oneself, now is there? One just tries to survive, has to survive, and keep surviving, and sometimes that's all anyone can do.

Arieol's body lies there cold, dead, scattered like dust across the four-winds, not even given enough dignity to be placed in a refrigerator, the bastards.

And where the hell had the violence of these images even come from?

They weren't real.

Arieol was just angry, really, really angry.

But they felt guilty about it, as well, all of a sudden.

The images

Picturing the images.

Why?
