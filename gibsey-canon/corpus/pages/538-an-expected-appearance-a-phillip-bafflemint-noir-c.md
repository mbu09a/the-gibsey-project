Becoming more and more flustered, and unable to locate his position in this bloated urban sprawl, he pulls up his phone's GPS.

And then he sees it.

He doesn't understand it, but he knows what's happened.

He's gone back in time, has passed through some portal, some threshold.

An Entrance Way.

His phone didn't show that he was in Gibsey World, the theme park which had subsumed and metastasized all of human civilization.

He's driving around, somehow, somewhere else.

According to his phone's GPS, he's in Austin, Texas, in the early part of the 21st century.

And the landscape is positively atrocious.

Somehow-again, likely his detective's intuition-he could sense that this place, similar to the reputation that Gibsey World had first tried to project early in its inception, had the reputation of a weirdness, of carnivalesque entertainments, and whimsy which contrasted with the state which surrounded it, but all he saw was urban sprawl upon urban sprawl, mazes of mini-malls, and a bunch of places where he isn't allowed to park.

What is happening?

How is he going to get home?
