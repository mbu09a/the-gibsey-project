"Well, and look at me! I've been breaking down constantly. I've got plenty of ailments of my own. But, you really have helped me, Arieol. You really have, and I want to thank you for that. The classic mentor archetype, and you didn't abandon me, you returned, and maybe that'll happen for you, maybe-"

"No, I-my story, my ailment, whatever you want to call it. It's not-it's not that literal. It doesn't have to be. Think about it, the sun was about to set and now it's rising. It's just a ride. We can change it anytime we want. It's not that it needs to change all the time, and you can't always change it. Unexpected disappearances occur and accrue. They're inevitable. But it's how you perceive those experiences, Glyph, and what you turn them into. What you let them create you into. And speaking of, you thought I was the one that was gonna disappear, right? Who knows? Maybe you're the one that's going to. Maybe you already have? Did you really think this ride would last forever?
