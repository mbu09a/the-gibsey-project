"When I have my first original memory, will it be something from the past?" She asks herself, interrupting her question, still on her back, looking up.

"What do you mean?"

"Or can it be from the future?"

"Like, what?"

"I mean about the future."

"What are you even talking about?"

"Or even the present? You said, in the training, I'm supposed to have my first memory, my first original memory, and that when it happens, I would know, and that only I would know."

"Well, if only you would know, how would I know?"

"But is there some kind of criteria, like, how do other people know? Like, is there a definition of how you're supposed to remember it?"

"No, you just know."

"So it could even be a premonition?"

"You mean something that's going to happen?"

"Yeah."

"That's not a memory is it? What are you doing laying out here by yourself?" She laughs at herself.
