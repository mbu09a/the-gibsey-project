I can't even begin to understand what made him go on. And you know what? During his lifetime, that shitty ass book that he wrote, that he lost his eyesight for, his supposed masterpiece, the one he worked so hard on, you know what happened? It only sold 3,000 copies. 3,000 fucking copies, Arieol. That's fucking it! I mean, that is a failure at the box office. That would destroy a person these days! You'd be laughed out of Gibsey World for a thing like that. 3,000 copies? That's less than the friends most people have on social media now, Ariel! But that wasn't it. That wasn't all. We stepped in. Gibsey intervened. When we were the ones to adapt it, when we mythologized it into infinity while its creator was deep in the ground, worms twisting through his decaying skull? When we were the ones who adapted it, it became one of the most infamous films that's ever been fucking made.
