And though there are many examples of such problems and processes, their work begins with a specific conflict, one which makes the process of both truly beginning and ending their work, the work, near impossible, and this problem, the problem in question, is not just a problem found within their work itself, the work which The Author is set to begin and has yet to finish, but is also a problem that's found within amateur writing, as well as within many creation myths, this specific problem being that the character, subject, or individual in question-in this case, the one within the scene that's currently being constructed-doesn't yet have a name, or hasn't yet been given one, though to be clear, the problem in question isn't this idea exactly since, as the author of this work, The Author could clearly give them a name or identity at any time, but instead, this problem (and/or conflict) is, to put it more definitively, the difficulty of selecting a name or identity to assign this given character (or to any character, subject, or individual, for that matter), which ultimately means that the problem in question is having to select this name or identity among a near-infinite set of possibilities and how, oftentimes, this process can become extremely overwhelming for an author, any author, even for an astute reader such as yourself, especially when or while this is all happening within the context of an unfolding narrative, including one's own introductory narrative, though in this case, the myth of this character is (and/or was) created well before the scene was first set (or was first to be set) rather than during a present moment in the character's experience, which-unlike amateur writing-is the much more common and paradoxical approach taken within creation myths, creation myths themselves being paradoxical specifically because, being myths of creation, they woud assume a creative act, an unfolding or process, but strangely and paradoxically enough, oftentimes they don't, or it's commonly conceived that they don't, and they're instead commonly conceived of as discussing events from the past, and while this is also true, there are also many creation myths that, additionally and alternatively, begin in a style that is often referred to as being written "in medias res," meaning that the plots, problems, or conflicts of such myths occur or develop in the middle of their actions, meaning that these myths seem to instead discuss a present moment or unfolding, a form of narrative structure which arguably assumes an act of creation, much like this particular creation myth currently being constructed does, or seems to be doing, when the individual and introductory character being used in order to set the narrative's scene hasn't yet been given a name or identity, and one is instead being created for them in real time, on the spot, by an author, in medias res, which has already been mentioned and established previously, and therefore that the narrative being constructed is very different than most creation myths, at least if to begin by comparing this unfolding narrative, the one currently being constructed in real time, in medias res, either with or as a creation myth, if that isn't assuming too much, which it very much likely could be since the character in question, The Author, the one being constructed in medias res, is not (or was not) a very skilled writer and is instead (or was instead) an amateur, which means that they either aren't or weren't very skilled as a writer or author to begin with, at least during the early period of their work, the work that's still in the process of being constructed, that's neither been fully begun nor finished, and this being due to their very redundant, rambly, overblown, and needlessly digressive style and structure, a type of style and structure which readers will often (and do often) find off-putting, a style and structure that may even be downright offensive to common taste and decency, which means (or meant) that The Author-the character in question-was (or is) not very skilled and was (or is) instead an amateur, or that they were an amateur within this section of their story, at the beginning of their legend, their myth, as it were, or as it was mentioned earlier, if that isn't assuming too much.
