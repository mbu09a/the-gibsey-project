Words.

Glyph would rip them to pieces if he could, would stab them in the heart like a voodoo doll of themselves. Can he rip apart the word, the name, Arieol? Or will he just remain there, seated in the mine cart, frozen, like he is?

Has something been done to him?

No.

Don't even think it.

He already knows.

Whatever's happening to him, this time, he's the one.

He's done it to himself.

He's forced himself to wait in line, yet again, afraid of the ride he's been waiting to ride, forever.

Or maybe he's been made to do it to himself by someone else, something else?

Some unseen or unspoken force or entity, out there, has manipulated his limbs like some doll in a doll house, re-positioning his body in various contortions, golem-like, into a mumbling mound, making him so afraid to speak he can't even speak to begin with.
