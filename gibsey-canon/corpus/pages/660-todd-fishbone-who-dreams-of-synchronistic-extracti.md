And so, like, Solomon transforms Ifrit into what he now is, and he's in this pillar guarded by an angel until Judgement day, essentially.

Huh? He kinda sounds like the idol to begin with? Again, with the repetition and doubling, what the hell is that about? And like, the story is getting convoluted at that point. It's like, multi-levels deep in frame narratives, and so, huh? He never noticed this.

The Shaykh is like, "That's a super interesting story, no doubt, but can you give us directions to where we could find some Jinns in bottles? This King, like, really needs them and finds them super entertaining and we're supposed to bring them back-and again, it feels like it's that same self-reflective narrative again, coming back over and over again, doesn't it?-and so Infit gives them direction to the City of Brass-

But, like, isn't Infit a Jinn himself? Isn't talking to him, like, breaking one of those vessels already? It's like they're doing the same thing twice, over and over again, and they don't know it? Why would they do that? He doesn't get it at all?

And so the company continues on with their journey, following the directions until they come upon a vast blackness and two fires facing one another, and Emir is like, "Shaykh, what's this blackness and these twin flames?"

Wait? Twin flames? Twins? That's pretty weird?

And it looks like the shaykh answers and is like, "According to the Book of Hidden Treasures, that means we're at the City of Brass," and it even sounds like he's quoting from the Book of Hidden Treasures directly. Huh?

That's strange? It's quoting a fictional book within its own story? Or is it even fictional? How very odd?
