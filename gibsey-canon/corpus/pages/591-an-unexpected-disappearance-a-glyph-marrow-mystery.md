Don't ask him to explain how, but this is what's happening to him, ladies and gentle-germs.

If linearity was nothing but the screen that represented our false selves to ourselves, if it was only ever a filtering process, and a diluted one at that, if it was cursed to forever mistake objects as ascending over subjects, and never able to contemplate a reversal of such a state of affairs, then what was purgatory but just another layer of life's deepening sediment, a projected above which existed down below, as well?

And this concept of purgatory reaches him as he wanders through that emptied lobby-and mind you, Glyph Marrow is not the easiest mind to reach. It, like Glyph, has to have come from somewhere, and although rare, it has somehow found him. Not that he notices it. Detective or not, Glyph's observational skills are, well, currently under a process of development, but he does notice the emptiness-figuratively, of course (though also literally for Glyph)-emptiness which temporarily retreats backstage, the actors replacing it not being the figures of fellow human beings here to move through the resort much like Glyph is, but instead being the many words and objects that layer the iconography of this place.
