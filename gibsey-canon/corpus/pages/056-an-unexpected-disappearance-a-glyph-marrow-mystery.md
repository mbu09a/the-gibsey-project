We are all colonized by images. Images, voices, and words. They are the most violent of all creatures, the words, as well as the kindest.

"Glyph! I've been trying to reach you. To speak to you!" The voice bellows out. "I've got a job for you! Are you there? Can you hear me?"

A job? That might even give me a chance to ride the ride? Wouldn't it? And that is my greatest desire in the whole wide world, to ride the ride. And the funny thing is, it doesn't even matter what the ride is. It can be any ride in the world, any word. Take your pick.

I can picture him, the man who contains this voice. He's my partner, or really not my partner exactly, since he's more above me in authority than we are equals, but I call him my partner nonetheless. Maybe I'm the one who's placed him there? But I do believe he deserves this place, to be there, if anyone does. I'm a detective and he assigns me my cases, though I don't remember being assigned one quite like this one before? But you go where the work takes you. And I've not heard from him in quite some time. Because I've been busy. Busy, waiting in line.
