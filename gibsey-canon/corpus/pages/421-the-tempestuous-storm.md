"Do you like the parks?" He finally asks, trying to find something new to explore.

"I do."

"Yeah? I love em. Live for em! Go as often as I can! What about you? I bet it's hard to on a professorship, these days. It's getting so much more expensive all the time." He does seem like a caring man, almost cuddly, like a teddy bear.

"I go every few years, but I don't just teach. I'm actually published, as well, which is honestly where I get most of my income. It's not the money that's an issue nearly as much as just how much time it takes for me to do the work that I need to do."

"Oh, so you write, as well." This brightens him a bit. It doesn't restore him completely to the mawkish coziness she'd first noticed upon entering the vehicle, but he's finding something.

"It's why I like the parks. They're works of creation." And she dons her own much more flimsy smile.
