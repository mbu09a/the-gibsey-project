But there's also this strange idea out there, floating around in the porcelain tomb of our cultural myths, that if you can't know for sure, that there's no point in knowing, or even trying to know, that we must know, must always know, that the data must always be collected.

But what's terrifying isn't the small deaths, or even the big ones, the lack, the loss, all we are fated to forget. It's having to remember, having to know, the fate of memory, and its inevitability, its endlessness, its infinity.

It is not what floats within us, we are what floats within it.
