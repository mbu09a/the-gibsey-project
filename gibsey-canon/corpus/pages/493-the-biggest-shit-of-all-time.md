This was the biggest shit ever to be found by anyone ever, throughout all of recorded Gibstory, after all, so who could be the messiah capable of flushing it out of existence?

And so of course, after his attempt, the flushing of the toilet, this eternal object-obstinate, unrelenting, unmoving, unstoppable, uncompromising- it remained.

And its stasis revealed a dark truth.

Whatever this was, it was not what was floating in the water, the water was what was floating within it.

There was a solidity and rigidity to its frame and structure, to the basic components of its very make-up, that he'd never encountered before within an object, as if its own molecules themselves contained their own, lower-level, yet-to-be discovered fundamentals.

He was convinced that if studied, whatever this was or whoever had created it, could reveal the secrets of the universe: Did life exist after death? Were there extraterrestrials? What about Gibsey? Who killed JR? Or even JFK? What has always been and would always continue to be the meaning of life? Why do we live only to suffer and die? Had he, in fact, left the oven on when leaving his apartment? Who the fuck was The Author of The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey? All of these burning questions could finally be laid to rest. But who within our intricate species possesses the vulnerability and shamelessness to claim to have created such a momentous object such as the one which he'd found in that receptacle of soon-to-be-created waste?
