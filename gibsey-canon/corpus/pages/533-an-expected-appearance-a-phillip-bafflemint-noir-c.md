It feels as if Judy had slipped something into his mind, his thoughts.

Her themes and prattlings had started to invade everything he saw.

But hadn't she also made a good point about how we alone are the authors of our own lives, and therefore, to write the stories we want to tell ourselves? To do otherwise was to be dependent, to lack agency, to fail to self-organize.

But even thinking about that, hadn't Judy been the one to make that point, not he himself, so how self-organizing was he really being if--

He grips the steering wheel, grinds his teeth, and tries not to overthink it, at least as best he can.

He pulls into a gas station, happy to step out of the car and do something other than silently thinking to himself. Even if was simply handing a 20 dollar bill to a gas station clerk, it would be better than being inside his own head with these thoughts of his, and he's right. When he gets out of his car and tries to pay for the gas at the pump, the machine doesn't accept his card for some reason.

Strange?

Must be some system error.
