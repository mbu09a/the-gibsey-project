"Please don't leave me alone," he cries out.

But nothing reaches back toward him.

He waits at the top of the first ascension.

Not knowing if he's frozen himself in place, or if he's just waiting for the cart to finally fall.

He waits, he hovers, and like the words, he haunts.

He haunts.

He haunts.

He haunts.
