Phillip Bafflemint sets down the Glyph Marrow detective novel he's been reading-if it should even be called that-while sitting in his car that's parked at his Ecco Resort apartment building. Like most detectives, and not unlike Glyph, he's been reading the book instead of investigating the cases he's supposed to be investigating. He stops before leaving his car to do a double take across the parking lot. He may not work as a private investigator, per se, but Phillip is intensely private, or tries his best to be, and thus wants to ensure he's walking up to his apartment alone.

Upon confirming the lot as empty, he exits his car and heads up the stairs of his building two steps at a time, practically brain dead, or at least brain-silenced. He's walked up these steps so many times that it's become a place where he can be quiet within himself, where he can turn the machine of his mind to an ambient setting and let it hum in the background like white noise.
