What a classic, classic character, the most classic of all characters.

More real than real under all those stage lights, the features of his costume topographically stretched into shapes and features that have only become more and more appealing as our Gibstory's marched on.

Have you seen the early versions?

They were terrifying, Ariel, truly terrifying.

One wonders how people even looked upon them once!

They looked flat out demonic!

And I mean, the cast members and extras around him, as he enters, they're ecstatic.

It's becoming really infectious.

It's all really coming together.

'Dickie!' 'Dick!' 'Dog!' 'Doggie!' 'Dick!'

'Huh, huh! Aw, shucks. Hi ya, everybody! Gosh it's good that you're all here! Huh, huh!'

'Yeah!! Woo hoo!'

More high fiving ensues.
