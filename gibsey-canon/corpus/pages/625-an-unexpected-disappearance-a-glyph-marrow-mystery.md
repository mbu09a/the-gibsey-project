Glyph's disappearance has not just been of physical nature, either. Over the past few weeks, all data has slowly faded. It started with the dial tone of Glyph's cell phone suddenly saying the phone number was no longer available. Then slowly but surely all records of Glyph had disappeared. Photos, social media accounts, friends, parents, all of them either gone or unavailable like they'd been whisked from off a map.

Even the files Stillman had collected on Glyph on his computer had somehow been deleted. Or maybe he'd just misremembered them? Thought that they were in a folder but they were never really there?

And maybe Glyph Marrow was the same way? Maybe he had never even existed? After all, you have to exist to disappear.

All Stillman needed to do was forget.
