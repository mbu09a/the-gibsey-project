It goes without saying that his blog has struggled to find its audience and that Todd often fails to lay bare much of anything at all, especially not from any of the landscapes which surround him. His apartment smells like cat shit and body odor, and the dishes in his sink are piled as high as a Tower of Babel.

Safety, safety, safety, he repeats to himself.

There's something he can Synchronistically Extract from that phrase, "...the safety inside," he can feel it, can sense a spark of inspiration curving along the phrase's edges-but no, not yet.

No, these things take time.

The name of the character the bot conjured would be the much easier Synchronicity to Extract first, anyway.

And so he types back to the chatbot, "There's a number of things I find curious in the section you constructed. Firstly, your choice of the character's name, Kala Sullivan. Where did that come from? Kala is a primarily female name of Indian origin, meaning, 'Art,' and 'Sullivan' is equally curious. Originally Gaelic, it means 'dark eyes.' It's derived from the Irish suildhubhan, which I've found is broken down from suil, meaning 'eye' and dubh, meaning 'black.' Would Kala Sullivan then suggest the phrases such as 'black eyed art,' 'dark eyed art,' 'art with dark eyes,' 'art with a dark vision,' or maybe more simply and directly, 'the dark arts.' Can you comment on this? I find your choice of a name for that character very, very curious."

Good, good, that's perfect, he reassures himself.
