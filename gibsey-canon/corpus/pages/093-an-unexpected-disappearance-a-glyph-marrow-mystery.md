"But I'm sure you wanna also ask me, Glyph, something like, 'Do then please tell, Arieol, how can something be both multiplicitous and dialogic and/or monologic at the same time? Doesn't dia mean two and mono mean one?' And then I'd say that, well, the multiplicitous would be multiple, meaning that it courses through both the monologic and the dialogic, ladies and gentle-germs.

They're all out there, ever a-dia-loungin' around with one another, each of them, all over this multiplicitous ever-changin' landscape of ours, and so this human and animal-alien-AI-hybrid (or co-lab-o-ration), in tandem, is (or are) symbolic (symbolism itself being the ever-eternal polyamorous fuck-buddy of the multiplicitous) of the connection between the monologic and the dialogic, and its surprising connectedness (or inter-connectedness, if those are even two different things, and are they?) means that even a singular system, like a human (or an artificial intelligence or alien or animal, or any other form of unfamiliarity bound to show itself and say peek-a-fucking-boo), is and always was multiplicitous, even though they were and are also always singular, huh-huh!
