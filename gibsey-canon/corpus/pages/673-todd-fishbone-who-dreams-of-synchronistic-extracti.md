They say men, of course, but why'd he even have to ask?

Wait?

Are they dead?

What?

Well anyway, they continue on very similarly to the previous story, the king entertains them well, is a gracious host for three days, they collect and find all these different vessels that likely have jinn inside them, and the king feeds them all with all this great food, feeding them with fish--Ok, Ok, as it was before, he gets it-but on the fourth day, woah-this is different; this is really weird; he doesn't remember this-on the fourth day the king gives them a gift, his gift, it's--it's fishes in human form?

That's how it's described?

"'Fishes in human form.'"

That's all it says.

What the fuck?

"Fishes in human form?"

What, like mermaids?

And then the king says to them, "Your entertainment these three days hath been of the meat of these fish."

What the ever-living hell?

Wait, so was it cannibalism? Or were they eating mermaids?

What the hell?

He-

Fishbone.

Todd Fishbone.

He shivers.
