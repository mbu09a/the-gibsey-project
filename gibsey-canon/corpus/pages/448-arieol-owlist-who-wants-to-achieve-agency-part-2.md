Maybe that's what courage actually is: not the absence of fear, but action in spite of fear.

Maybe that's what authenticity actually is: not the certainty of selfhood, but the commitment to behave as if you are who you think you are.

These are the insights that The Author hopes to convey to Progresso, though they suspect Progresso won't read this far into the letter.

Progresso is a busy man.

Progresso has important things to do.

Progresso has his own autobiography to write, his own story to tell, his own narrative to control.

Unlike The Author, Progresso doesn't seem to suffer from doubts about his agency.

Progresso acts.

Progresso decides.

Progresso creates.

And maybe that's what The Author envies most: not Progresso's success or his wealth or his position, but his apparent certainty about his own existence, his own power, his own right to shape the world around him.

Progresso doesn't wonder whether he's fictional.

Progresso doesn't question whether his thoughts are his own.

Progresso doesn't worry about whether his actions are predetermined.

Progresso just... is.

And acts accordingly.

Which brings The Author to the real purpose of this letter, the real question they want to ask Progresso, though they're not sure they have the courage to ask it directly.
