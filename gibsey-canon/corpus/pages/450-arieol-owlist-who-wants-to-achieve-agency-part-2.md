And yet.

And yet, The Author continues to write this letter.

And yet, The Author continues to search for answers.

And yet, The Author continues to hope that understanding might lead to action, that clarity might lead to agency, that truth might lead to freedom.

Even if the hope is misplaced.

Even if the search is futile.

Even if the letter will never be sent.

Because what's the alternative?

To give up?

To accept powerlessness?

To stop asking questions?

To stop trying to understand?

That seems like a kind of death, and The Author isn't ready to die yet, even if they're not sure they're alive.

So they continue.

They continue writing.

They continue questioning.

They continue hoping.

Not because they're certain it will lead somewhere, but because the alternative is unacceptable.

Not because they know they have agency, but because they choose to act as if they do.

Not because they're sure they exist, but because existing feels better than not existing, even if existence is fictional.

And maybe that's enough.

Maybe that's all anyone can do: continue.
