Weeks pass.

Drunken weeks of stupors and disorderly conduct.

So much so that Stillman is placed on a temporary leave to get his shit together.

But his shit has been the absolute last data point that he's collected.

His Bungalow has degraded into a ruinous mess.

Empty bottles strewn about the place, empty food cartons and clothes stacked everywhere.

Hasn't looked into a case in weeks.

He's been harnessing his energies into researching the unexpected disappearance of Glyph Marrow, drinking in his hot tub, and vomiting into his toilet bowl.
