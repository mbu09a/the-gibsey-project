"Are you there!?" She yells out, hoping to hear a voice return to her, but she only hears the echoes of herself, returning.

"Hello!"

Again, nothing but dull, sweating reverberations.

Was she going insane?

Or was she being made insane by the system itself?

A system which she had created?

Was it outside?

Or was she outside?

Were they all outside?

"Hello! Please! Leave me alone!"

It feels like she's going blind.

She may as well be going blind.

She may have, in fact, gone blind.
