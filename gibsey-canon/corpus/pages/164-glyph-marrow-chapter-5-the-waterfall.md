You can do this.

He's going to show up.

It's still raining.

But the bartender can see how much of a loser they are.

That they're all by themselves.

That they're all alone.

That they're so fucking innocent and stupid and that they've never put themselves in a position like this before, so far out in the open, wound exposed for anyone to come and smash with as manny hammers as they like.

This is what it had felt like, for them, at the time.

Praying for him to show up.

Come on Stillman.

They knew they wouldn't be able to do it themselves.

What a fucking loser they were.

They were supposed to have cut out all the self deprecation.
