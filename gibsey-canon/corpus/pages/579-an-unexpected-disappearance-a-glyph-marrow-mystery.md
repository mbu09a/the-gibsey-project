Imaginatoring, he supposed. And again, that was his world, as well, wasn't it? Always teetering on the edge of disaster due to so many constructs they'd developed out of nothing but blind curiosity. How do we make a geyser spew color? It wasn't that far off of a mindset from what had formed nuclear weapons, after all, if he thought about it. If you boiled it down, all of it was just a long series of "what ifs" that might've just gotten a bit too far out of their control.

He felt kinda stupid seeing all this in a multi-dimensional painting of a now defunct vintage Gibsey attraction, but it's funny what compartmentalization can do to the skipping mind. More excess, huh? Better he focus on the uselessness of this painting here, anyway, let that be the excess that erupts within himself, and leave Glyph and his fears of what's happened to the poor kid to bubble in the scarcity of the backstage of his brain like a sputtering mud pot.
