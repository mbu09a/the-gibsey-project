But don't get me wrong, we need Scrillio's fantasy to continue to exist. We have to. We absolutely have to. And we also need to believe in his fantasies. Gibsey World is a world of fantasy, after all. It's built on fantasy. Fantasy is its basis, its center which it revolves around. It's what keeps it functioning, spinning, so to speak, so if Scrillio doesn't think what the trades say about him is true and real, that he's the last auteur we've got left, and if we don't also think this about him, and even believe in it ourselves, then what becomes of the event film, or the art houses, let alone the prestige picture? These are all already on the decline as it is, and so you've got to believe in them. You've got to. We've got to have articles with titles like "The Last Auteur," blossoming in the trades, and old Gibseyan classics, like The Last Picture Show have to keep playing, forever screening and rescreening, in old, near-empty, preserved-by-the-fact-that-they're-now-landmarks landmark theaters. We all have to build a cannon of sorts, to build and rebuild our own Gibseyan Vaults. all the time. There's always some sort of golden age that never really happened where the greatest, shiniest, most dazzling star of all stars shined and continues to shine the most brightly.
