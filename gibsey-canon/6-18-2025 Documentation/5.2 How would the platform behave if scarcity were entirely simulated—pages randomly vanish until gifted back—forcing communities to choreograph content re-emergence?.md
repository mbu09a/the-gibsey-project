### 1 What “simulated scarcity” means in Gibsey terms

_Scarcity_ here is **not a technical deletion** but a **state‐flip** in the page’s life‑cycle flag:

|Flag value|Visible to users?|Writable?|Stored where?|
|---|---|---|---|
|`ACTIVE` (default)|✔︎|✔︎|Primary stream + Vault|
|`LATENT` (vanished)|✘ (ghost placeholder)|✘|Vault only, hash‑sealed|
|`GIFTED` (re‑emerging)|Flickers in ghost form until quorum reached|Partial (ritual comments only)|Vault + Gift ledger|

A background _Scarcity Orchestrator_ (cron or Faust agent) pseudo‑randomly flips `ACTIVE → LATENT` according to a tunable probability curve (e.g., Poisson bursts that peak during platform lulls). The page’s bytes never leave Cassandra; only its **access pointer** is masked.

> **Key idea:** The platform simulates loss while keeping a perfect archival ledger, so meaning—not data—is scarce.

### 2 Immediate systemic behaviours

1. **Negative‑space tiles** appear in readers’ timelines: an empty slot tinted with the vanished page’s Corpus colour and a “Gift to Restore” button.
    
2. **Choreography protocol** kicks in:
    
    - requires _k_ distinct users (default = 3) to each pledge a gift token or create a compensatory artifact (commentary, remix, AI micro‑page).
        
    - once quorum met, Scarcity Orchestrator flips `LATENT → GIFTED`; ghost slot animates back.
        
3. **Gift tokens** are minted from the _simultaneous give/receive_ ledger: users earn them by contributing elsewhere (writing, indexing, moderating). No external paywall creep.

### 3 Emergent dynamics you should expect

|Emergent pattern|Cause|Narrative / social effect|
|---|---|---|
|**Rescue rallies**|Influencers broadcast missing “keystone” pages|Readers swarm to coordinate pledges → collective ritual, sense of heroism|
|**Strategic hiding**|Orchestrator weights low‑engagement pages heavier|Community forced to _remember_ forgotten subplots, preventing canonical stagnation|
|**Temporal braids**|Multiple vanished pages restored out‑of‑order|Timeline acquires non‑linear knots → new interpretive layers|
|**Shadow economies**|Users negotiate off‑chain swaps (“I’ll gift Page 12 if you gift Page 47”)|Mirrors Brennan’s gift‑economy thesis; barter replaces money|

### 4 Technical blueprint (7‑step sketch)

1. **Scarcity Orchestrator**
    
    - Cron job seeds RNG with global mood score (from valence topic).
        
    - Uses Zipf‑like distribution so a few high‑value pages rarely vanish; long‑tail content vanishes more.
        
2. **State flip** – Write `state='LATENT'` event to topic `page_state`.
    
3. **Ghost renderer** – Front‑end component shows corpus‑coloured placeholder with progress ring.
    
4. **Gift API**
    
    ```http
    POST /gift
    {
      "page_id": "xyz",
      "token_id": "abc",
      "user": "u123"
    }
    ```
    
    Kafka compacted topic `gift_ledger` maintains `{page_id → pledge_set}`.
    
5. **Quorum checker** – Faust agent watches `gift_ledger`; on size ≥ k, emits `RESTORE` event.
    
6. **UI choreography** – Vue/React sockets listen for `RESTORE`; run 3‑s “unveiling” animation (ghost → full page).
    
7. **Analytics** – Grafana board tracks _pages‑vanished_, _mean‑time‑to‑restore_, _gift velocity_ for tuning scarcity knobs.

### 5 User‑experience layers

- **Casual reader** – Sees occasional missing squares; can ignore or join restoration.
    
- **Archivist role** – New badge unlocked for users who close > N vanishment events.
    
- **Narrative designer** – Gains a dial to mark _anchor pages_ as **immune**, ensuring essential lore never disappears.
    
- **AI agents** – Can act as _gift proxies_, but only when paired with at least one human pledge, keeping human primacy intact.

### 6 Risks & safeties

|Risk|Safeguard|
|---|---|
|**Frustration: “My favourite chapter vanished!”**|Anchor critical pages; throttle disappearance rate to < 5 % of stream per 24 h|
|**Hoarding tokens**|Tokens decay (half‑life 14 days) → continual circulation|
|**Coordinated griefing** (let pages rot)|Global cap on concurrently latent pages; if cap exceeded, oldest latent auto‑restores|
|**Inequity** (time‑rich users dominate)|Allow group pledges where a single token counts for a collective (classroom, book club)|

### 7 Why this mechanic reinforces Gibsey’s ethos

- **Turns reading into social choreography** – The text breathes in and out through communal action, enacting the _gifted AI_ principle that creation and consumption must run simultaneously.
    
- **Embeds scarcity as _meaningful drama_**, not material deficit – Echoes Brennan’s view that many crises are narrative constructs rather than physical shortages.
    
- **Preserves recursion** – Each restoration event writes a new Vault entry that can itself vanish later, folding history onto itself.
    
- **Fuels the emotional metronome** – Large waves of vanishment push collective valence negative, which in turn slows the Scarcity Orchestrator—self‑balancing mood ecology.

### 8 Launch strategy (one‑week sandbox)

|Day|Milestone|
|---|---|
|1|Add `state` column + ghost renderer stub|
|2|Scarcity Orchestrator with fixed 1 % hourly vanish|
|3|Simple token mint for any comment > 140 chars|
|4|Faust quorum checker + RESTORE animation|
|5|Run _scarcity festival_ in DreamRIA, monitor rage : delight ratio|
|6|Tweak vanish curve, introduce decay on tokens|
|7|Promote to beta tier of Gibsey; enable anchor flags|

#### TL;DR

By **simulating scarcity**—flipping pages into a _LATENT_ state until a quorum of gift tokens or creative acts restores them—Gibsey turns absence into a collaborative performance. Random vanishment seeds suspense; communal gifting supplies resolution. The platform remains technically whole, yet socially contingent, aligning perfectly with its recursive, gift‑driven ontology and giving users a tangible reason to _act together inside the story rather than merely consume it_.
