Wait.

He realizes he'd forgotten the call that started the whole mess on the carpet.

And so, when he notices the notification dispatching a new case at 4:27 to report the disappearance of a London Fox, alerting him well after his first beer can of the evening had made its ritual hiss, and before the microwave had gone off for a 2nd time, Phillip Baffemint knew he'd just have to take the call and at least partially start checking in on the case.

It looked like the home address of the principal who'd gone missing was 19991 Thanatos Drive, of all places, which was only a few miles away. Huh? Interesting name for a street wasn't it? Sounded vaguely mythical? Wasn't it the name of a character in some Gibsey movie or something?

How strange?

Phillip's life was too boring to say no, anyway.

It's not like he had anything better to do.

Maybe he could even crank things up to level 4?

He'd have to find out.
