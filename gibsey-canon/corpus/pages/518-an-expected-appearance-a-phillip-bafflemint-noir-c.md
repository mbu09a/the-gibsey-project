"Well, before you go Mrs.-wait what was your name again?"

"Oh, darling, you never even asked!" She shifts into a faux-shocked-act, throwing a hand over her face, and leaning her head back to sigh, "Judy S. Cargot."

"Sorry I didn't-"

"It's perfectly fine, darling. You can continue. You look as if you still need to ask me a question. Don't daddle. Continue on."

"Are you a part of Manny's religion too?"

"Pssssh!" Judy clicks her tongue at him. "How dare you? I'm what's called a Subversionist! We live by the creed that Disney is Dead, and we killed it, or him, or whatever it is. Like chaos magicians, we tend to view systems in a non-linear fashion."

Phillip's face goes red, growing even more confused. Why would Judy believe in an ideology that threatens murder? And who was this Disney person? Were they even real or were they just a fictional construct? He isn't being told what he needs to know-he can feel it-and he's starting to get frustrated.
