I'm forgetting. Where does the theme song go next? I think it's something like:

We are here to give our dreams To every boy and girl, A place so big that you might scream Or maybe even hurl, Castle beyond an entrance way To hold yourself aloft, Step inside our movie set, And turn your brain right off!

And look, I know I'm kind of having to reconstruct this for you in order for you to get it in the script, so it's a little confusing for me to remember. I said it was in sequence, but trust me, it wasn't like that during the process, not at all. It wasn't even remotely in order, or if it was, it was so fucking repetitive you couldn't even tell!

Picture this.

This director, this fucking supposed auteur, is hallucinating and regularly. Do you understand me? It isn't orderly what's been going on, what he's been doing.

No, not at all.

It's fucking chaos, but anyway, interrupting this, well it wasn't an interruption since it was a part of the thing, as well, but I mean interupting the scene, the performance, interrupting it is an announcer, an unseen voice, a recorded voice, like it does at the park entrance theme song.
