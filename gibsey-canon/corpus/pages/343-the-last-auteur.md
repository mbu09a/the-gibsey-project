Which, I'm realizing, may not be a good thing.

They could really fuck up my plans here.

Even Scrillio is sort of stuck in his tracks.

He doesn't even call 'cut' this time.

They're that good!

He just lets the scene continue.

He doesn't even stop.

All the characters from the show enter one last time, the cameras pulling out, and the DP's got a few others with fisheye lenses there to capture the whole scene from a distance, from every conceivable angle. I mean, the budget on this goddamn thing!

Scrillio's eyes fill with tears.

His mouth trembles, the fucking man-child that he is. You can hear him sniffling, and he doesn't care. He just lets it happen, watches it happen, like I am, being there, on set, and all together, in unison, all of the cast members unite, in triumphant glee:

You'll have a good time, just leave it up to us. Welcome to a place where dreams are made. The price is worth it, we promise, you will see!

Where all uncomforting, difficult thoughts disappear! The most magical place on earth is here!
