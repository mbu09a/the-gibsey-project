The key insight, struggled into existence by the film's yet-to-be-identified author, was that all the film needed to thrust its audience into a narrative, all any narrative needed to burst forward from the shuttering-click, to swirl into existence from the light of life, was a time and place, the key insight being that all times and places were just that, times and places, times and places to be found, waiting to be known, longing to be known, documented and recorded, skipping beats, scratching records, grooves and edges galore, and so if all you need is a place and time to construct a narrative, and there is no place and time that isn't a place in time, then there never wasn't a narrative, not even once; everything was ever in a state of unfolding itself to the world.

Point the camera, pop the popcorn, crank up the prices, and watch the cash flow in. You could even put the cameras in their hands and make them the filmmakers, allowing them to then become both audience and filmmaker, an endless loop, a circulatory system, closed, finalized, and without end.
