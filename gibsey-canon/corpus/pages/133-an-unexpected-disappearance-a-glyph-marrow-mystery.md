And so that's the section from Chapter 5. Fairly interesting, no? I thought we'd end on something positive tonight.

Any questions?

(She laughs)

We still have a few minutes.

Yes, go ahead.

Interesting. The question was should we view this as a cautionary tale or as an unavoidable reality that we must come to terms with?

Well, Gibsey if I know. I have absolutely no idea with that one. I guess you'll have to read the book and decide for yourself.

What if I had to?

Well, I'm not sure. I don't think I can decide. I don't like taking ideological positions in front of hundreds of students in my classroom. (Laughs). But since I probably can't avoid it, I do remember that we talked about how inaction is a form of violence, today, so that probably has something to do with it.

Other questions.

In the story does Glyph literally become the landscape?

Well, oh boy.

I am not an English teacher, I want to remind you.

Wow.

That one is really hard to explain.

No, maybe not.

I'm not sure.
