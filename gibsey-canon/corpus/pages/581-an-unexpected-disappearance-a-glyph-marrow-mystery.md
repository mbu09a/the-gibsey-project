The waterfalls were his favorite because of their flow. A waterfall represented data and detection, how every stream would eventually return to itself, how it would fall, travel on its journey through the stream of itself, climbing back up, and then fall again, so there was no escape, and there was so much water to be collected. The water would always continue to flow. It was why he also loved the open air of his Bungalow so much, the excess of it, the feng shui, the glass windows which allowed him to stare out at his hot tub and Lake Venture Vista, which-with yet another newly poured scotch in his hand-he wafts back into, letting the water ripple. So much water, the mud pots, the geysers, the waterfall, the hot tub, the lake, the gleaming stream of reds, yellows, and oranges as the sun comes up to splash against the green trees planted to sustain the immersion of the park opposite the clear blue lake, housed within the purple tile of his hot tub.
