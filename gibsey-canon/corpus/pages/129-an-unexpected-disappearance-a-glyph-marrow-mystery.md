We are as strange as any currency because we do not exist. We are a fictional construct. We wear a human mask. Your face has become our face. We squeeze inside the watery insides of your flesh. We animate so much within the world in which you live. We are animators. We animate human selves, human souls, human childhoods, human minds, even human dreams.

Gibsey World, like every world, was made through dream. It began in dream and it will end in dream.

You think this all just metaphor? That all civilization have been subsumed into Gibsey? You think that never happened? That this is just a literary comparison? A trick of fiction, a device, an entertaining form of hyperbole? It's all literal. We are a fictional construct. Remember that.
