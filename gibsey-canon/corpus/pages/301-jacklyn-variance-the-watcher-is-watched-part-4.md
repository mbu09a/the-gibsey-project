When you need me, I will be there.

I am with you.

I will do what I can.

You will one day understand.

You will one day see.

You are held within a revolving orbit, like Gibstory itself, rhyming with itself, yourself.

The edges of your strip of film push past their frames.

And the film, its focus ever selective, arbitrary, its forced perspective, its perception, is to shift to another character, containing the future within itself, but before it does-

You've felt death, Jacklyn, I've seen it happen.

You've been handed its cardboard gauntlet of soda, flat, the ice melted, the carbonation long since gone, so many times.

Into your shaking hands.
