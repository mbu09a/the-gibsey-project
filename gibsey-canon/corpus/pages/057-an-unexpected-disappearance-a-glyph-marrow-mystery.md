"Glyph Marrow! You're not exactly easy to get a hold of. Memory isn't super reliable, either. One of those increasingly amnesiac detectives we all know so well. Look, I'll try to remind you. Do you remember me? I'm Shamrock Stillman. I'm your partner. We've worked together forever!"

"Oh, I know. I knew! I knew! I remembered!" I yell this out at him. I yell this out. I communicated!

"You did! You did!!" And there is such a sincere joy to his voice now, within his voice, in the voice of this man who is Shamrock Stillman, at hearing me say this. "Oh, Glyph. It's so great to hear you. It really, really is."

"How did you reach me? I've been walking from queue to station for, well, I don't even know for how long?"

"Hell if I know. It's very hard to explain."

"Trust me. I understand."

"You said you wanted to ride the ride didn't you? Well Glyph how do I explain this? Look. Look up. Do you see? You're at the front of the line. Look, dee! You didn't even notice before, did you?"

And he's right. Shamrock Stillman is right. I'm at the front of the line. How had I never noticed before?
