Upon arriving at 19991 Thanatos Drive, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. No forced entry, no sign of a struggle, nothing of the kind. Though Phillip did notice the door was unlocked when it opened accidentally at the touch of his knock, almost like the place was haunted.

"Hello?"

He knew better than to go inside, but his assigned case was a disappearance, and the door had slowly opened upon his walking up to it, and had done so basically all on its own, so what else was he supposed to do?

The smell hadn't been horrible, but Phillip's nostrils were just as much in need of a constant state of comfort as anything else within his life, and so he did wince, and harshly, at least when he first walked in.

A thin layer of water, not a total flood, but at least a light one, sloshed below his feet within the carpet of every room.

But most importantly, there were papers, pages, and notebooks everywhere.

They covered nearly every surface of the house's space, and it would appear that all of these various pages had on them some sort of material that involved the written word.
