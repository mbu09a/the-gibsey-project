The trains then enter the finale, the climax of the attraction, The Caves. Although the space of this area was rather slight, its designers were able to craft quite the climactic moment for their audience members through the use of darkness and forced perspective, 22 water sculptures, wonders, sculpted stalactites, stalagmites, and cavernous environmental wonders. The designers used neon chalk to simulate the rainbowed lighting of various pools, waterfalls, and geysers This area was the crowning achievement of the ride's set pieces. The train would slow down to let passengers soak in the breathtaking views, one even flowing with six colors of the rainbow, posing a particular challenge to the ride's engineers. If colored chalk was to be used to create such effects, how would all the colors not splash, blur, and mix together, swirling into an opaque gray? They developed a mesh of thin synthetic fibers which eliminated nearly all of the splashing of the water when it hit the bottom of the falls, extending the life of the rainbow fountain, and because the mesh was transparent, blacklights could be hidden below and shined up at the waterfall, illuminating the falls with startling artificiality. Again, it was a mixture of the old and the new, natural wonders and human engineering, the blending of the subversive and the traditional that would bleed into a formless gray in less trained hands, the essence of the Gibseyan mindset and accomplishments.
