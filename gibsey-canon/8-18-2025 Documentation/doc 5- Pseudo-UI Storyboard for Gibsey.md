Alright — here’s a **pseudo-UI storyboard** that shows how Gibsey’s interface can evolve from simple symbol clicks to a full holographic narrative view. Think of it as a **sketched comic strip** for your product, blending your color-coded symbols, Kafka events, and holographic layers.

# Pseudo-UI Storyboard for Gibsey

## **Frame 1: The Entrance Grid**

- **What user sees**:  
    A vertical scroll of 16 colored symbols (your Corpus, each in its unique hue).  
    Each symbol has four orientations (↻ dial or hover rotation).  
    The Vault timeline sits quietly at the bottom, empty at start.
    
- **Action**:  
    User clicks **Princhetta’s symbol (pink)**, orientation = Read/Canon (XC).
    
- **System reaction**:  
    A Kafka `ui.symbol` event fires. The node lights up, pulsing once.  
    Vault glows faintly, ready to catch the result.

## **Frame 2: Page Reveal**

- **What user sees**:  
    The right panel opens, showing Princhetta’s canonical page text (e.g., _“Princhetta Who Thinks Herself Alive”_).  
    At the top: page metadata — `[7:XC:C]` → Section 8, Princhetta, Read Canon.
    
- **Visual cue**:  
    The symbol “spins” into alignment, indicating orientation locked.  
    A thin glowing line drops into the Vault timeline (like a bead threading).

## **Frame 3: Ask/Branch**

- **What user does**:  
    User types into “Ask” box: _“What if Princhetta refuses to perform?”_  
    They submit.
    
- **System reaction**:
    
    - Kafka produces `gibsey.ask`.
        
    - Enricher emits `generate.page.request`.
        
    - DSPy PageGenerator consumes → creates a speculative Princhetta page.
        
- **What user sees**:  
    A **branch bead** sprouts off the canonical thread in the Vault timeline.  
    The new page text appears in a side-by-side card, tinted to show **User provenance (U)**.

## **Frame 4: LoopBack (Return Debt)**

- **What user does**:  
    They keep reading. After 2 speculative pages, the system enforces a **LoopBack (T1)**.
    
- **What user sees**:  
    The branch arc curves back toward the canon bead in the Vault.  
    Animation: the speculative bead **snaps** back into the canonical thread, glowing brighter where it reconnects.
    
- **Narrative cue**:  
    The text of the bridge page explicitly guides back to the canon next page.

## **Frame 5: Holographic Graph View (2D → 3D)**

- **Toggle pressed**: “View as Graph.”
    
- **What user sees**:
    
    - Canonical ring of 710 pages laid out in a circle, each bead colored by character.
        
    - Branches float outward like coral fronds.
        
    - Hovering a bead shows the page text; clicking zooms it into the right panel.
        
- **Kafka integration**:  
    Each new `page.done` event animates a new bead _appearing_ in the graph, connected by edges (`NEXT`, `LOOP`, `FORK`).

## **Frame 6: Holographic 3D Field**

- **Transition**: User switches to 3D mode (Three.js prototype).
    
- **What user sees**:  
    The ring is now a glowing wheel in 3D space.  
    Branches extend into depth; arcs shimmer like filaments.  
    Colors swirl as events stream in.
    
- **Animation**:  
    Each Vault save crystallizes into a denser node, refracting multiple colors.  
    Drift pages hover translucently, tethered by faint threads.

## **Frame 7: 4D Playback (Temporal Hyper-Object)**

- **Action**: User hits “Replay Session.”
    
- **What user sees**:  
    The entire session’s event log (from Kafka) replays:
    
    - Beads appear in order.
        
    - Branches sprout, drift, and collapse back.
        
    - The whole field becomes a time-lapse hologram of the narrative.
        
- **Final effect**:  
    A shimmering jellyfish-like hyper-object, each tendril representing choices, each glow showing convergence back to canon.

# Design Language Notes

- **Colors**: anchor identity (the 16 hues for characters).
    
- **Edges**: elastic, glowing filaments (NEXT = taut line, LOOP = curved arc, FORK = branching coral).
    
- **Vault timeline**: the “floor” of the UI, a rainbow of saved beads.
    
- **Events**: every Kafka event is an _animation beat_.

✨ **Takeaway**: This storyboard shows the journey from a symbol click → page read → speculative fork → canonical return → holographic visualization. It matches your architecture: **symbols as topics, pages as beads, Vault as crystallization, Kafka as the animation driver**.

Do you want me to extend this into a **wireframe mock (boxes/arrows, ASCII sketch style)** so you could show Maggie or even your students how the interface might _look_ step-by-step?
