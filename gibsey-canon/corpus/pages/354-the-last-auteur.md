Make him do it to himself. It's a moral position, Arieol, towards Scrillio himself, that even his crew wasn't willing to take. They'd just pat him on the back until kingdom come if it was up to them, those fucking believers. But I'll take it. I'll suffer for the art that I must create, for the worlds I must construct. I'm willing to. I'll take on the heavy yoke if I have to. And I have to, and often, for both his sake and yours, Ariel. You see, what all our realities need are limitations. You have to cut. You have to sever. You have to be a fucking surgeon. The seventh day is for rest. And he did it to himself. I didn't even have to say a word.
