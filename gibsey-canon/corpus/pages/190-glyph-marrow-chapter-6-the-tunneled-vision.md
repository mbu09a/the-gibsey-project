"I've wondered about that since the very beginning," Glyph nods, messing with his seat belt to focus, "I don't give too much thought to it, simply because it's obviously just better to believe resisting it is possible than the alternative, but who knows? Maybe it wants to die? Maybe it's exhausted itself? All that infinite content and all those thousands so easily content? If Gibstory can die, why not Gibsey? Isn't that what you said about organisms, organizations, back there during The First Ascent?"

"But maybe you're just resurrecting it?"

They pause, both of them shaking with the weight of their dialogue.

The Second Ascent, unlike the first, has a much more conventional track layout for a roller coaster, a bit less theming, though this being a Gibsey joint, it's not like there isn't any, of course. There's always theming in Gibsey World. It's a theme park, after all. About midway up the Ascent on a platform to the right is a billy-goat with a dynamite stick in its mouth meant to foreshadow the explosive finale to come.
