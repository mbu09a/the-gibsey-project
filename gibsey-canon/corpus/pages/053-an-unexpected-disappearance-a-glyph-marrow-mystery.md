I've now entered a building, a station. Picture words. Picture every image that you've ever seen before. And put them all together into one singular moment. And I'm not talking about the images. I'm talking about the words contained within the images. That many words. Throw them all into that singular space as if you're thrusting them into a pool of water, like they're all heliotropic water-balloons that burst when they make contact with air. The words scatter in the winds of this place.
