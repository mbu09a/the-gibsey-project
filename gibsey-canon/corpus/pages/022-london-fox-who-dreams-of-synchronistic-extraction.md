Come closer.

It whispers to her.

Hurl yourself into my abyss.

And watch me as I stare back at you.

I'm always watching.

I will always watch.

I will watch you as you plunge into my depths.

Enter my theme park.

Enter my oasis.

The oasis which I have created for you.

Watch me carry you to my mecca.

I will convert all of your stories, all of your loves and energies.

And I will reform them into my image.

I will transform them into the networked depth of my own swirling perfections.

I will drain your energies.

And replace them with my own.
