I'm starting to feel really bad for the crew members at this point, Ariel. I truly am, and I already felt bad for them before. I mean, the shoot's stretching on way longer than it should've already. And I'm goddamn CEO. I hardly feel bad for anyone!

We've blown past lunch, regulations be damned.

But I'm not saying a word.

My own stomach's growling.

"The CEO's stomach is fucking growling.

The goddamn CE-fucking-O.

But the thing is, Arieol, I have my own art to suffer for, my own goals to accomplish.

And I know it'll be worth it.

And so I keep waiting it out.

Two cast members enter the scene holding a set of prison bars and set them before Petey. The police officer who handcuffed him takes out this comically large set of keys and pretends to lock the cell, throwing the keys offstage. Petey's glasses fall off and onto what is supposed to be the cell floor, and this actually isn't a part of the originally written scene either, by the way, the falling off of the glasses. I think the glasses fell off the costume itself, but the cast member, the one playing Petey, the thing is, they're a master improviser. They just go with it: 'Can someone help me find my glasses? They fell off somewhere. Hello? Anyone? Hello? I need to find my glasses!'
