Per Gibsey's instructions, the Special Order, which has been Gibstorically maintained through genetic and hereditary means (a practice which has recently come into question within some communities interested in Gibseyan Mysticism) is in charge of creating any future symbols for The Corpus once they, as the Special Order, have decided which symbols are to be declared Dead or not. Due to this, a newer faction has splintered off from this original order, deeming themselves what they've termed the Subversionists. This recent group, thought of typically as a cult splinter faction-or even more negatively by some within the original order as ticks, parasites, or even as a virus that threatens to upend the order's original authority-are specifically committed to the negative aspects of The Corpus and exclusively refuse to use or consult any of its predefined literature or symbols and instead draw exclusively from either the interpretive body of the Corpus' unspoken negative space or the dead symbols which have been regulated to the Dead Corpus. To do otherwise, according to the Subversionists, is to choose the false death of life rather than the true life of death. "Gibsey is Dead," is a common slogan of this group and is commonly spray painted around the parks by subversive individuals. Many of their more radical members even believe that we may all already be dead, and it's even believed, even more radically by some, that Gibsey World may not have ever even existed.
