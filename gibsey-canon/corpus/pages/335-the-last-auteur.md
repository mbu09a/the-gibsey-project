Very un-Gibseyan of me.

Cut that, if you can, my pessimism.

Cut anything, uh, pessimistic, if you hear me say it.

Cut it.

I don't want it in the script

I don't want to come across as pessimistic to my future audience, Arieol. That's the last thing I want. I- just-uh, I'll, uh, I'll just-I'll return to the scene.

They finish this section on this longer refrain of the chorus before transitioning to the next one, and Scrillio's way, way out there, forcing them to do it over and over again.

Like I've said, the exhaustion that's been building up on set, it's getting worse and worse.

And the performers, they're starting to crack under the pressure themselves, but they're holding on to it, for now, holding on to the final refrain of this section, and they just keep having to hold it, note after note, again and again and again.

Good mornin', good mornin', to you!
