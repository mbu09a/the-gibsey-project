And then Oren Progesso, the dead CEO, the dead God, the dead Gibsey, opens his mouth and speaks.

I am Language.

My name is language.

My name is symbol.

Now, hear me

Hear my voice!

I shall never be contained.

I am the water.

The life.

The movement.

I am contained within all things, all words, all images, all dreams.

There are no words to describe me.
