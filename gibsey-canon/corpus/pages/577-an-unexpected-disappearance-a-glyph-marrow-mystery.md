Dead on, the painting was the classic set of six geysers he'd glared at earlier before the hot tub. He wondered how they'd gotten the streams of the water to be those colors so consistently day after day. Had to be a logistical and financial nightmare, bringing such artificiality to nature on such a daily basis. People couldn't just be wowed by the natural stuff anymore, could they? Had to go and infuse it with decadence, one of the essential rules of this place. Though living in a Hawaiian Oasis Bungalow himself, of course Stillman had always appreciated a little excess. It was a nice place, seated on Lake Venture Vista, though he always felt a little guilty for living there. It seemed no amount of compartmentalization would completely erase that from his memory, though it's not like he was going to live anywhere else. Maybe even his guilt was part of the process, a way to almost unconsciously and internally brag to himself about what he'd gotten away with, all he'd conquered, further excess.
