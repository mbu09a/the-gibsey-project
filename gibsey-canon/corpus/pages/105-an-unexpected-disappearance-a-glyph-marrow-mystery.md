But Glyph doesn't know why.

He isn't given a reason.

The person sitting next to him, who'd claimed to be Arieol Owlist, disappears, maybe even forever, for all he knew.

What?

What was happening to him?

He's seized with such feeling.

Such loneliness.

And a question dawns on him.

Had this chatterer that had been chattering all the while, had they been his one and only friend?

And were they now gone forever?

Was it something he'd done?

Was it something he'd said?

Was it his words?

How they'd combined?

His thoughts?

Had he conjured this fate into existence?

Alone at the top of The First Ascent?

What was it that he'd wanted?

Had he gotten it?
