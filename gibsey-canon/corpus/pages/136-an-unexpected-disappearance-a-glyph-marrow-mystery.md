Well, and that's why I'm torn. I do think I may start to wonder late at night about whether or not it is, in fact, literal-I guess you could call it a monster in that section, huh?

Oh. (Laughs) Or, they said when I'm sitting on the toilet.

Yes, well, very good. We're learning together now, aren't we?

Oh, what was the term for it? An externality?

What's more external than an abject-

Oh, and yes, we don't want to forget what Gibsey World was based on, so the comparison should be fairly easy to make.

Don't forget.

Show don't tell, remember?

Oh, and that reminds me! I do have a theory about The Author's gender. I have noticed there being multiple climax points in the novel, which seems to mirror the female rather than male sexual drive, which I do find rather interesting.

Typically, the average plot of a given novel is fairly male. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution, it all represents a very male-ceenterd structure, but with the novel departing from that structure into a more novel approach, I do wonder if that suggests that The Author may be female, if you can forgive me one last aside.

OK, one last, last, final question. Truly the final question this time.
