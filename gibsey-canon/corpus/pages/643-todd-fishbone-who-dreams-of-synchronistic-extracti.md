Todd Fishbone sits at his laptop, sorting through the chatbot Dream RIA's response to his initial query to, "Write a short expositional paragraph that introduces a character to a reader and include yourself as a character, as well as the act of your own writing as a recursive metafictional device."

Todd is a dreamer, a blogging, podcasting, conspiracy theorist dreamer, an acolyte of all kinds of synchronicities and magic which he writes about in his blog which he calls The Sub-Zone. Clothes, trash, and multi-colored stains of various spills he's failed to attend to populate his apartment like a churning network of ants marching far down below the vertical insulation of an airline passenger's overhead seat.

Safety, safety, safety.

He repeats this word to himself while pouring back over DreamRIA's expositional opening.

"...the safety inside."

What a curious phrase?
