Arieol's looked everywhere for Variance, but all they've found are traces.

Reading Jacklyn's Analysis Logs nearly as quickly as they were first written, maybe even as they were being written, he's traced and re-traced her steps as best he can, but so far, all he's been able to find, the only image left from all that content, is Jack Paralnace sitting on a bench, writing after the film-screening, referred to later as Parlance at the Bench, and this wasn't the later-to-be-made theatrical recreation of the event either, with all its stasis and Beckett influences, this was Parlance, in reality, still sitting on that damn bench, pre-adaptation and everything, one could even call it original.

For all Arieol knew, maybe Variance didn't even exist.

And also, there's always that troubling thought that this was all Paralance's doing that can't help but tip-toe across Arieol's shape-shifting awareness.

Arieol twirls the idea around their tongue like a mint before shifting between watching Parlance's typing and watching what it is that he's typing, if there even is a difference between the two.
