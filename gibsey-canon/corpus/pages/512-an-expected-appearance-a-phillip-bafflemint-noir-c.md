In a world of this much variance, you could always return, even if they said and thought you didn't.

Her mouth shakes, but then she swallows some thought and returns back to the mask of her jovial self. "Ah, I do miss him, miss him even just hearing you asking about him.

Manny has a wealth of material. It's all here at your fingertips, all this data waiting for someone to detect it. If you put the pieces together, I just know you'll find the right answers, darling, and it'll all be oh, so very beautiful." She beams, but he can sense a fracture in her expression, like she's just about to crack. He knows there's still something that's bothering her that he needs to know about, that's pertinent to the case. She came here for a reason. He knows it.
