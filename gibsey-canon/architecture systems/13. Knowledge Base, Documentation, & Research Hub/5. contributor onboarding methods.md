# Onboarding Contributors & Ensuring Knowledge Transfer in GitBook and Obsidian

**Main Takeaway:**  
Establish a structured, multi-modal onboarding program that combines clear contributor guides, interactive tutorials, templated workflows, and ongoing “living” documentation sprints. Leverage GitBook’s built-in invite flows, change-request templates, and analytics alongside Obsidian’s community vault CONTRIBUTING guide, template library, and Dataview dashboards to keep new contributors productive, informed, and connected.

## 1. Structured Onboarding Paths

## 1.1 GitBook Onboarding Workflow

1. **Automated Invites & Roles**
    
    - Use the GitBook Organization Invites API to script invitation emails and assign default roles (e.g., _create_, _review_)[1](https://gitbook.com/docs/developers/gitbook-api/api-reference/organizations/organization-invites).
        
2. **New-Contributor Checklist**
    
    - Publish a “New Contributor Checklist” page (modeled on Mojaloop’s) that covers:  
        – Account setup: GitHub, Slack, project channels  
        – Locally syncing the docs repo via Git Sync  
        – Introductory reading: project overview, style guides, repository structure[2](https://docs.mojaloop.io/legacy/contributors-guide/new-contributor-checklist.html)  
        – First issue guidance: how to find “good-first-issues,” fork workflow, branch naming, and PR etiquette
        
3. **Change-Request Template**
    
    - Provide a pre-populated change-request template that prompts for: PR description, testing instructions, related docs pages, reviewer assignments[3](https://gitbook.com/docs/guides/best-practices/make-your-documentation-process-more-collaborative-with-change-requests).
        
4. **Interactive Tutorials**
    
    - Embed short videos or sandbox environments (e.g., CodeSandbox, SwaggerHub) via blocks to demonstrate branch-based editing, change-requests, and deploy-preview features.
        
5. **Analytics-Driven Follow-Up**
    
    - Use GitBook Analytics to flag contributors who haven’t returned after initial edits and send automated “getting started” nudges.
        

## 1.2 Obsidian Onboarding Workflow

1. **Community Vault CONTRIBUTING Guide**
    
    - Ship a top-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` vault note that steps through: vault download, core plugin setup (Templates, Dataview), link format, folder conventions, and submission process[4](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/CONTRIBUTING).
        
2. **Template Library**
    
    - Curate a set of templated notes (e.g., “New Note,” “Plugin Category MoC,” “How-To Guide”) stored in `00 – Contribute/01 Templates` that automatically populate frontmatter, tags, and link placeholders[4](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/CONTRIBUTING)[5](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/templates).
        
3. **Map of Content (MOC) Dashboards**
    
    - Provide ready-made MOCs for “for Group X” (developers, storytellers, researchers) that list starter pages and tutorial links via Dataview queries.
        
4. **Pull Request Tutorials**
    
    - Offer a simple step-by-step for non-Git-savvy users: “How to add content through GitHub” with screenshots, and embed an “Open in GitHub.dev” link to edit CONTRIBUTING.md directly.
        
5. **Discord/Slack Intro Session**
    
    - Automate a welcome DM with links to community channels, recommended settings, and “first tasks” (e.g., fix a typo, add a missing link) to build confidence.
        

## 2. Multi-Modal Knowledge Transfer Strategies

1. **Identify & Prioritize**
    
    - Maintain a living “Knowledge Transfer Plan” page in both platforms outlining critical domains (API specs, world lore, research methodologies) and risk levels of knowledge loss[6](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/careers/managers-supervisors/knowledge-transfer/knowledge_transfer_manager_guide.pdf)[7](https://blog.procedureflow.com/knowledge-management/knowledge-transfer-plan).
        
2. **Capture & Curate**
    
    - Host regular doc sprints—90-minute “Doc-nights” where SMEs update stale pages flagged by analytics or orphan nodes in Obsidian’s graph view.
        
    - Record short Loom tutorials for complex procedures (e.g., running local dev environments), embed in GitBook and link in Obsidian.
        
3. **Share & Store**
    
    - In GitBook, use Collections and page groups to surface updated content in release notes; in Obsidian, update a “Recently Updated” dashboard via Dataview.
        
    - Assign “Doc Owners” for each module with clear review-due frontmatter metadata, and automate periodic reminders.
        
4. **Mentorship & Peer Learning**
    
    - Pair new contributors with “Doc Champions” for 1:1 walkthroughs of the knowledge base structure, both asynchronously (recorded tours) and live via screen-share workshops.
        
5. **Continuous Culture**
    
    - Celebrate doc contributions in community channels—“Docs MVP of the month”—and highlight before/after diffs to reinforce positive behaviors.
        
    - Integrate knowledge-transfer metrics (e.g., number of updates, sprint participation, MOC coverage) into team OKRs to sustain momentum.
        

**Conclusion:**  
By codifying contributor checklists, leveraging templated guides and interactive embeds, and embedding a continual knowledge-transfer rhythm—supported by analytics, mentorship, and community recognition—you ensure that both GitBook and Obsidian remain discoverable, up-to-date, and actionable for **all** contributors, be they developers or storytellers.
