However, to finally become more specific about this character, meaning The Author, it may be important to note that there was (and is) a separate problem and conflict which occurs (or occurred) within their work, a conflict which exists within their early work, a problem that is additionally important to mention in addition to the previously mentioned set of problems, and this problem is (and/or was)-you may have noticed, being the astute reader which you are-a problem which was referred to previously, this problem being their looping and rambling style and structure, a style and structure which never seems (or never seemed) to end, a style and structure which, even when read by astute readers such as yourself, plummets with the gastric force of a shoddily built roller coaster, a style and structure that, like a ride-vehicle speeding on a track, threatens to careen off into oblivion at any moment, despite the rider's hands, arms, and legs being held inside the vehicle at all times, as initially promised, the splintered wood and metal of the coaster jutting out in dangerous patterns across the clattering of the page, hanging nails and loose bolts tumbling out to clink into the void below, the blindingly uncomfortable ride-vehicle shaking the rider's body in every direction, every which way, blurring their vision, hypnotizing them, as if in trance, and during this early period of their work, the Author's work, their problem, The Problem, meaning what tortured them most, meaning The Author, was that this looping and rambling structure would often cause (or often caused) their readers, even dear and astute readers such as yourself, a great deal of frustration, and these negative reactions toward their early work would also often cause The Author a large amount of discomfort and confusion, and this would occur throughout both the process of their writing and during the process of their writing's reception (its period of reflection), because, sadly enough, they-The Author-initially didn't or couldn't believe that their writing was amateurish at all, even though they knew that it never seemed to end and that it had a rambling and digressive structure, a structure which would often be perceived as off-putting, and what this further meant was that, at least initially, they'd been fully aware of this idea, this problem, and that because of this, it did have a structure of some kind, and therefore, it was deeply intentional, maybe even intentional to the point of approaching some sort of aesthetic goal or practice, a goal which they'd continually sworn they'd not only intended but had also even seen evidence of and accomplished during the process of their work's creation, a goal which they'd been absolutely positive of at various times thoroughout their writing, during the process of its creation, but to be clear, what confused them most, or at least more specifically what conflicted them most, or what they found to be most problematic about their work, was that afterwards, upon reflecting, or upon their work being reflected upon, both by themselves and others, meaning upon looking back at their work, when it was shared with others, meaning The Author, that no matter what they did, this aesthetic quality and the intention of their work would always and did always continually dematerialize, disappear, and vanish, like a kind of magic, like a woman being cut in half, like a body in a barrel thrust into the threatening waves of a ruinous waterfall, like a series of locks fastened around one's arms and legs to be wiggled out of, somehow, by means of light and sound, and what this ultimately meant was that, no matter what they did or tried, the skills which they'd initially thought and percieved as existent, in fact, would continually fail to appear or materialize once their work was completed, even though they'd initially thought that they'd been there all along and had even seen these skills and goals within the work itself, in medias res, throughout the process of its creation, and this would all happen at once, all despite their many attempts, meaning, The Author, despite their many strengths and repeated efforts, all that meaning, The Author.
