And his brother Brayden, his many pranks and jokes-which he himself later lost the motivation to continue due to the weight of passing time-most of which had been harmless; he was notorious for mooning them constantly, for dropping his pants at the drop of a hat, even at the most inappropriate of times, even going so far as to draw images on his ass in preparation for the various act (smiley faces, Xs, you name it, and how had he even done so, on his own ass?) for its random recipient to bare witness.

And there was his sister Jennifer, 7 years away from him and closest to him in age, she'd affected him deeply, had shown him so much about what being alive would be like, for good or ill, represented so much of its best and worst possibilities, all he would want to either maintain or subvert, the hundreds of boardgames, the vacations and trips, putting on a raincoat to disguise himself and burst into the room while she was hanging with a group of her friends, and he'd been so disguised, so how could she've identified that it was him?

But despite whatever memories he couldn't even conjure any longer, they'd all, in his mind, been just as culpable in his inevitable retreat.
