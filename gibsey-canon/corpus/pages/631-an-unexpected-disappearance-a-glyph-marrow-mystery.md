Though he won't be riding alone this time.

A passenger sits down next to him.

"Hey, we talked about you from what I remember."

Stillman looks up, almost frozen, still life.

"You're Shamrock Stillman, the detective, right? Yep, we definitely talked about you. I remember. Now, I don't really know how I know what you look like exactly, but I'll chalk it up to some sort of device, suspension of disbelief, and isn't that also what it's all about old Stillman, buddy, being able to believe in the things we find unbelievable. Who knows, maybe you can actually find one more piece of new data on that old friend of yours that went and disappeared on you. Ain't it funny how that's always what happens in all the sacred texts? How it's not until someone's given up completely that they finally achieve their desire. Probably has something to do with ego-death or something? Maybe that's the thing we actually desire. And would-ya-look-at-that! That sounds positively thematic to me! We're on a roll now, aren't we Stillman?"
