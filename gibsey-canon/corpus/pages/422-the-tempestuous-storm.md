She doesn't want to be here talking to this man.

She wants to be alone

She wants out of this van that's crawling down the road at a snail's pace.

Yet she also feels guilty for feeling this way.

He picked her up during a fucking tornado, after all.

But the van's barely moved.

They aren't even out of the parking lot yet.

Still stuck, waiting in lines of traffic.

She does have an obligation, after class, to visit the original version of herself at The Modern Resort after her classes and conference period are over, but she's also dreading this exchange because she hasn't yet read the piece of writing that her other self, the other Natalie, the original version of Natalie, had sent her, and so she has two choices: does she want to exit the vehicle, send a worried email of explanation and get chided for not making an appearance, and go face the fact that she hasn't read what she was sent by her original self? Or does she want to continue sitting next to this sweating man in the van to make it to her classes she knows she will already be gtoo late for?
