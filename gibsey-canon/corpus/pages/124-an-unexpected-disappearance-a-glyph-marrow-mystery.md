That's the story of the ride, isn't it? The settlers of Rainbow Revene didn't know that the mountain was a sacred spot to the local Native Americans, and that it was cursed. The Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride is certainly sacred to our contemporary world in a similar way, and maybe An Unexpected Disappearance has then appropropriated it, the ride, which would then mean the book itself is cursed. It did certainly feel haunted whenever I read it. Maybe Gibsey World was always cursed, doomed to decline like all rising civilizations, to fall. It's Gibstory, after all, or a concept so common to it.

Well, and that's the interesting thing about Gibseyan Mysticism, every blessing is a curse and every curse is a blessing. It's not an idea for the faint of heart.

Well, it's because it mixes up the subject with the object, and if you think about it, that's a very violent thing to do.

If you're walking toward me with a knife, I better hope you don't mix up the subject and the object. And if you do, well, then you probably wouldn't feel you did anything wrong if you'd mixed them up, would you? It's a way of shrugging off responsibility, one would think.

Well it would mean you didn't stab me then, right? The thing was, you didn't. You didn't stab me, the knife just passed through my body while it was in your hand, neither subject nor object. It's a really terrifying idea.

No wonder everyone's gone crazy.

Oh, I guess just with being alive. (Laughs)
