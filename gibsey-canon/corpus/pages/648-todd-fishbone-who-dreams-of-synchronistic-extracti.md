Being a creator of content, one might assume that daily life for Todd would be a relaxed and simple affair, but it was anything but. Sleep plagues him more than anything, though he doesn't usually perceive it as much of a problem and more perceives having to sleep at all as the true problem, a way of thinking which he can recognize, at times, would become a problem, but as such a problem, like sleep, it was one which he'd avoided confronting to the point where he'd stopped perceiving it as a problem to begin with.

And maybe he's right.

Maybe it never was.

And it isn't sleep alone which plagues him, either.

As within so many of our lives, externalities tend to present themselves and most of the time when we least expect them.

This week, his pacing daily list of to-dos has acquired a new set of items. Large branches from a tree, the same tree, recently plummeted into his bathroom window, on two separate occasions, one of them due to a rather harrowing wind storm, and the other due to a lightning storm that itself resulted from a combination of earthquake and thunderstorm.

Various traumas of both a psychological and environmentally disastrous nature have been on the rise, as of late, providing those in the conspiratainment industry like Todd ample opportunity for quotidian speculation.

And though these disasters may be traumatic, they've at least provided him plenty of content for the blog and podcast, not that it matters, really, when no one really listens to either of them.
