Even Glyph laughs, giving the cigar a few more puffs, this time a bit more successfully. Though he also notices rather quickly that the hill of the Second Ascent is a bit more shallow of a climb than that of the first.

"We're nearing the end," Glyph comments.

"That's true, any last words before we drop."

"But wait, I was enjoying the dialogue!"

"Now that's a first! But wait, I thought you thought it was a monologue? That I was just chatterering at ya? I guess you finally found the guts to participate, at least for a little bit back there? Sounds flat-out thematic to me."

"Wait? I thought you said it was both?"

"Now, you're gettin' it."

"But wait, can you stop time? I'm not ready yet."

"You can stop it wherever you'd like. That's up to you."

At the top, the peak of the hill, right at the edge of the climax before the cart screeches down to hurdle past the Second Ascent, the cart lurches to a halt.
