Lines from this stupid ass song burst out at them like some kind of tempestuous storm, lines like "When it's gonna be my turn? / Don't forget me," and so much so that they they wipe away the tears and smile, really smile, but not a purely happy smile, either, though it is a pure smile, feeling like they're full-on wearing the face of Gibsey, in that moment, as they drive, that they've placed them over their eyes like a mask, that it's wearing their face, and that this novel they've been writing-or whatever else it was or is--is pulling these tears from out of their eyes, itself, all it had reminded them of, all their many slippages and mistakes, and this was only the first book, The Entrance Way, and so, so much of it was just beginning, an endless beginning, so this wasn't an end, was it?

But it sure felt like one.

A beginning and an ending.

Janus-style.

Or, maybe something else.

Two faces at once.

And what was the ending?

Were they to be killed?
