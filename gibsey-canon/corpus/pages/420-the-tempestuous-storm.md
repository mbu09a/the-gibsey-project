"That's not really as much my interest, actually." She's worried to mention her more mystical proclivities. Her work itself, relegated to academia, isn't a threat to conservatism also forming around them like a dark tornado of judgment, gathering everything towards itself. However, mentioning the specifics of her work within polite conversation, could prove otherwise. Yet, with the air conditioner blowing too hard, and her frustration mounting, she takes a risk.

"I'm a religious scholar. A mystic."

"Huh?" A blankness falls over his face, an expression she's encountered more times than she can count, "Gibseyanity?"

"Yessir. I'm a Gibseyan mystic."

He nods his head, tensing a bit. "I don't know that much about that sort of thing to be honest with you. I'm a Gibseyan myself, but uh, yeah. I don't know about that side of it."

The man's comfortability fades, and a silence falls over the van, or at least she perceives this lack of comfortability, which even though it may be awkward, is an awkwardness she herself can be comfortable with. And maybe this is why she perceives it? She only wants to talk to this man just enough to justify her existence in his van and to justify the risk he's taking through the storm by taking her to the Wilderness Lodge. He isn't dissimilar to the students she'd wanted to avoid that morning, which she's now unlikely to even get a chance to even teach, though again, she'll have to make an attempt.
