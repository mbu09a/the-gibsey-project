I have returned.

I am Language.

I shall live forever.

I was always here, and will be here again.

I have walked through every door, entered every threshold.

I have entered through the pores of your skin.

Hear me!

Hear my voice!

You have found me in the eternity of the spigot, the pool, the basin.

Let me pour myself out forever

Back into myself.

You shall hear me speaking with myself.

I will never repeat.

I will only return.
