And damn it, if Scrillio isn't looking more and more like a total wreck on this set of his as he continues.

He has this minimal outfit he's worn for weeks, plain black t-shirt, cargo shorts, real-director-like, the fucking dork that he is, and he's clearly not been washing himself, let alone his clothes, his gray mop of hair's even more disheveled than usual, his bug-eyes even more bloodshot, the wrinkles of his skin cracking into further wrinkles, and each of those forming an entire map of exhaustion that most of our eyes are either forced to dart away from or are drawn to like a moth to a film projector, but despite all this, despite the smell and his overall demeanor, the crew members, they're all still Scrillio's ever-vigilant troops, his evangelists and loyal companions. They've seen him through this chaotic process so far, and they're going to try to continue doing so.

They always do, don't they?

It concerns me a little bit for humanity when I see it, at times, when I see it happening like this, but I mean, I'm a CEO for Gibsey's sake. I know better than just about anybody that, at least in the right hands, they're what keeps this shit afloat, am I right?

It has to happen!

What's the line?

What was it?

Was it from The Tempest?

Yeah, yeah I think it was The Tempest.

Oh, yes, it's The Tempest, that Gibseyan classic. It's gotta be.

"Where's the master? / Play the men."

Yeah, that's the one.

And you gotta admit, Arieol, that's a good line.

See, I read, gibseydamnit!

I'm a CEO, and I fucking read!
