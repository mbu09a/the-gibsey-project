"I'm having problems with words," I said to him, probably looking defeated, or however one looks when confessing their ailment to a doctor who doesn't believe them, which is likely defeated.

"With words?"

There was no break in his confusion at the time.

It was almost as if he didn't even try to understand.

He was immediately confused.

"Or with objects, I mean," I replied.

"With words or with objects?" The doctor asked, his face crumpling like paper.

"With both."

"I'm not sure I understand?"

"When I look at things, everything I see isn't only what I'm seeing. Everything contains everything else. When I look out at the world, it isn't a purely visual experience for me, anymore. I see everything as words. Simultaneously, and all at once. Like that clipboard that's in your hand. When I see it, I don't just see a clipboard, the physical object of a clipboard. I also see the word clipboard somehow, and both at the same time. Everything is also a word for me, all of a sudden, and it's been that way ever since it all began, and I don't know why it's happening."
