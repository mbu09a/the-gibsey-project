The spokes on the wheel turn, and you're passing a sign. I mean, I'm passing a sign. I'm passing a sign now. I'm passing! It says, No Drinking, Fighting, Whistling. No Kidding! Wait, does that mean I'll die of thirst if I stay here? These are the rules that were once displayed before I'd entered this wretched purgatory, and the rules must be followed, or the terror will take hold. It's already taken hold. There are too many words, lying in wait, to destroy us all.

And one must resist the horrible ache of their relentless flow. The blood, the marrow. I'm holding onto the railing. Thank Gibsey it's been placed there. Without it, the wind, the movement, the light, it would have carried me away from this earth like an alien abduction.
