Well, to get back to it, he has this opening sequence he's tried to get right again and again and again.

Cut. Action. Cut. Action. Cut. Action.

Over and fucking over again.

It's making me nauseous to watch it.

It really is.

And to explain, it's done out of order, I mean when they're shooting it, out of sequence obviously, but I'll try to see if I can reconstruct it for the Saving Mr. Banderas script. From what I remember, the chorus of the theme song started at the top of the scene, and Gibseydammit. You have to understand, I heard this set of lines probably hundreds of times while on set. It's why I remember them so well. I was there more than just one day, ok? I'm just reconstructing this for the narrative to function. Let me see, I think it went something like:

Welcome, welcome, welcome!

Welcome, welcome, welcome!

And by the way Arieol, I'm sure you know, but in case you don't, this is the theme song that plays at the beginning of the morning at the park when it opens, outside the entrance way of The Magical Dominion.

Think of it as opening credits for the park.

Or like a footnote.

Yeah, like an endless footnote that just keeps on going and going on forever, stretching on and on, until the end of time.

And this is what he's going for, the fucking imbecile.
