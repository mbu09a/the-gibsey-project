# Current QDPI Progress (as of 7-4-2025)

QDPI is still in an **in-progress** state, with certain foundational components already underway and others in planning. The most concrete progress so far is on the **Symbol-Rotation Embedding Compiler (SREC)**, which can be seen as a stepping stone toward QDPI’s goals. SREC is a toolchain that processes the visual symbols of the QDPI alphabet and prepares them for use in the system[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/336aa204a3e159cf4a6de72174dab0ba34a71ef3/backend/srec/README_INTEGRATION.md). Concretely, SREC takes SVG files of the “Corpus of 16” symbols (with their different rotations) and generates **CLIP embeddings** for each variant, storing these vector embeddings in a **ChromaDB** vector database[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/336aa204a3e159cf4a6de72174dab0ba34a71ef3/backend/srec/README_INTEGRATION.md). This allows the system to **recognize and retrieve symbols by semantic similarity** – essentially giving an AI the ability to understand a glyph’s meaning or find the nearest glyph for a concept. We have integrated SREC into the backend with a set of API endpoints (for uploading new symbols, batch processing, status checks, etc.)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/336aa204a3e159cf4a6de72174dab0ba34a71ef3/backend/srec/README_INTEGRATION.md)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/336aa204a3e159cf4a6de72174dab0ba34a71ef3/backend/srec/README_INTEGRATION.md). It runs as a background watcher that can automatically detect new symbol files and embed them, and there’s a startup routine to ensure all symbols in the corpus are compiled when the system boots[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/336aa204a3e159cf4a6de72174dab0ba34a71ef3/backend/srec/README_INTEGRATION.md).

However, SREC is **not yet fully production-ready**. In testing, we managed to get it working in a development environment (including writing a few bug fixes and adjustments), but a few tasks remain:

- **Image Processing Dependencies:** SREC relies on ImageMagick (via Wand in Python) to rasterize or handle SVGs. In development mode, if Wand is unavailable, SREC currently falls back to placeholder embeddings[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/336aa204a3e159cf4a6de72174dab0ba34a71ef3/backend/srec/README_INTEGRATION.md). We need to ensure the production environment has these dependencies (or include them in the Docker image) so that real image processing occurs and the embeddings are accurate. This likely involves updating Dockerfiles and using `SREC_ENV=production` settings[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/336aa204a3e159cf4a6de72174dab0ba34a71ef3/backend/srec/README_INTEGRATION.md)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/336aa204a3e159cf4a6de72174dab0ba34a71ef3/backend/srec/README_INTEGRATION.md).
    
- **Parity Marks and Additional Glyph Components:** As of now, SREC focuses on the base symbols and their four rotations. The **parity mark** aspect of the glyph (the small marker indicating state) is not yet implemented in the embedding process. We will need to decide how to handle parity – possibly by augmenting the symbol SVGs with the parity mark in each corner and treating those as distinct symbols to embed. This could quadruple the number of glyph images (256 total) to process. Generating and embedding all 256 glyph variations (16 symbols × 4 rotations × 4 parity states) is a next step to fully cover QDPI-256’s space.
    
- **Integration with Core Workflows:** Right now, SREC runs somewhat in isolation – you can manually trigger it or call its API to embed symbols. The plan is to integrate it into the **core startup and data pipeline**. For instance, on system startup, a function like `ensure_all_symbols_compiled()` runs to embed any missing symbols[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/336aa204a3e159cf4a6de72174dab0ba34a71ef3/backend/srec/README_INTEGRATION.md), so that the vector store is always up-to-date. We have to connect this with the main FastAPI app and ensure that any service that might need to query symbols (for example, a search service or an AI prompt generator) can easily tap into ChromaDB and get relevant glyph vectors.
    
- **Testing and Tuning:** We’ve begun basic testing of SREC – e.g., embedding a few symbols and querying them – and fixed bugs as they came up. More thorough testing is needed, particularly to measure performance (embedding ~256 images can be time-consuming, so maybe we cache results or precompute them) and to ensure stability (file watcher should not miss updates, etc.). We also want to test the end-to-end flow: can we embed symbols, then use those embeddings in an actual AI task (like searching for a symbol given a text description)? This will validate that our symbol embeddings indeed align with expected semantics.
    

Beyond SREC, other pieces of QDPI are still in design or prototype phase. A **Python prototype for QDPI-256 encoding/decoding** exists (we have a script that maps bytes to a string like `"S12@O2-P3"` format and back)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/Gibsey-Old/blob/0b5142f79e39ed9324fae6bc11b31c7037c5ab0a/docs/backlog/QDPI_256.md)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/Gibsey-Old/blob/0b5142f79e39ed9324fae6bc11b31c7037c5ab0a/docs/backlog/QDPI_256.md). We will need to integrate such encoding logic into the platform, possibly as a library or service that any component can call to translate data to/from QDPI glyph strings. This will go hand-in-hand with creating a **glyph font or rendering mechanism** – currently, the prototype uses a text placeholder (like "Sx@Oy-Pz"), but ultimately we want real glyph characters. One immediate step is deciding on how to represent these glyphs in the system’s UI and storage: we might register a custom Unicode Private Use Area range for them or use a specialized font sprite-sheet[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/Gibsey-Old/blob/0b5142f79e39ed9324fae6bc11b31c7037c5ab0a/docs/backlog/QDPI_256.md).

In summary, the current progress has established the **scaffolding**: we have the concept solidified, an embedding system (SREC) partially working to give semantic grounding to symbols, and prototype code for encoding. The road ahead involves **connecting these pieces** (so that, for example, an AI can take a piece of text, encode it as glyphs, and store it, then later retrieve and decode it) and **filling in gaps** (full glyph set, parity handling, production robustness). We acknowledge QDPI is a long-term endeavor – at this stage it’s about getting the fundamentals right and integrated, so that the system can start “speaking QDPI” in small ways and we can iteratively expand its fluency.
## Design Notes

- **In-Progress Nature:** QDPI is currently **partially implemented** – the concept and encoding spec exist, and the SREC component provides a foundation (symbol embeddings for semantic grounding), but the full pipeline is not yet operational. All planning acknowledges this is a work in progress. Our documentation and code include placeholders and prototypes that will be iteratively refined.
    
- **Compatibility & Transition:** We plan to introduce QDPI alongside existing systems rather than replacing everything overnight. This means building **shims and translation layers** (e.g., lossless conversion between Base64 and QDPI for external interoperability[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/Gibsey-Old/blob/0b5142f79e39ed9324fae6bc11b31c7037c5ab0a/docs/backlog/QDPI_256.md)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/Gibsey-Old/blob/0b5142f79e39ed9324fae6bc11b31c7037c5ab0a/docs/backlog/QDPI_256.md)) and ensuring legacy data can be encoded/decoded as needed. The adoption will be gradual, running in parallel until QDPI is proven stable.
    
- **Custom Font / Representation:** Since QDPI glyphs are not part of Unicode (by default), we must define how they are represented in interfaces and storage. We may allocate a block of Unicode Private Use Area code points for these glyphs or develop a custom font. This is noted as a requirement in the spec (implementers need to assign code-points or use a custom font)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/Gibsey-Old/blob/0b5142f79e39ed9324fae6bc11b31c7037c5ab0a/docs/backlog/QDPI_256.md). In the interim, a human-readable token format (like `S1@O2-P3`) is used for debugging, but the end goal is true symbolic characters.
    
- **Microservice Architecture Alignment:** Interestingly, the QDPI design’s division into 16 base symbols aligns with modular architecture – we already have plans for services like Graph Engine, Workflow Engine, AI Orchestrator, etc. We will likely map these subsystems to specific symbols. This provides a **consistent addressing scheme** across the system: a glyph can inherently reference which domain it pertains to. This mapping will be documented and forms a part of the architecture contract between services.
    
- **Error Handling and Security:** As we implement QDPI, careful attention is given to **error handling** – both detecting corruption (via parity/orientation checks) and dealing with malformed or malicious glyph sequences. We’ll treat the QDPI parser similar to how one treats a network protocol parser: with strict validation to avoid crashes or exploits. On the security front, QDPI by itself is encoding, not encryption[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/Gibsey-Old/blob/0b5142f79e39ed9324fae6bc11b31c7037c5ab0a/docs/backlog/QDPI_256.md). We will layer existing security (encryption, signatures) on top of glyph streams where confidentiality or authenticity is required (for example, signing a glyph ledger of Magical Bond transactions).
    
- **Future Research & Inspiration:** The QDPI effort is informed by diverse sources – from data encoding theory to semiotics. We’ll continue to research techniques (like advanced arithmetic coding for compression, or visual linguistics for glyph design) to improve QDPI. The concept of a “living grammar” means QDPI can evolve: we expect to iterate on symbol design (ensuring glyphs are visually distinct and meaningful), possibly add or redefine axes as we learn from usage, and keep the system extensible. Backward compatibility is a goal (earlier QDPI versions should remain interpretable in later ones)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/gibsey-newest-old/blob/7c414057e919e9091bbbe03518771039caff327c/QDPI-spec.md), which we’ll achieve by treating older glyph sets as subsets of newer expansions.
    
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Implementing a custom protocol like QDPI is not without risk. It’s complex and could introduce bugs or performance issues if not optimized. To mitigate this, we are building extensive **unit tests and prototypes** (as seen with the Python prototype and SREC tests) to validate correctness. Performance testing is part of the plan; if certain operations (like rendering glyphs or querying the vector DB) become bottlenecks, we’ll optimize (e.g., using C++ or Rust for critical sections, caching results, etc.). Also, we are mindful of **developer learning curve** – the team will need clear documentation and tools to work with QDPI. We’re creating helper libraries and visual aids so that developers can debug glyph sequences without needing to decode by hand.
    
- **Outcome:** When fully realized, QDPI will be a **cornerstone of the Gibsey architecture**, tying together narrative elements with system mechanics. It exemplifies the project’s aim of fusing creativity with computation. The ongoing work on QDPI is a testament to Gibsey’s experimental spirit – we are effectively inventing a new data language for a new kind of platform. The success of QDPI will be measured by how seamlessly it empowers features (like faster data sync, richer AI storytelling, better error resilience) and by the emergence of a community that can read and perhaps even _write_ in this symbolic language. For now, we proceed step by step, continually aligning QDPI’s development with Gibsey’s needs and iterating as we learn. The path is set, and with each implemented piece (from SREC’s embeddings to the first end-to-end glyph transaction), we are moving closer to a system that **speaks in symbols** and operates on story-like logic.
