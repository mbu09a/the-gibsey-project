Making its expected appearance, Phillip's world fades to black and up swims the floating visage of a telepathic, disembodied ear. The curve of the ear's ascending helix, the softness of its flesh, the delicate pinkness of its auricular shape, and the ambient hum of its inexplicable hovering, although overwhelming, somehow puts him at ease.

"Can you hear me?" The ear transmits through the telepathic sound waves produced by the small bones nestled behind its vibrating drum.

"Yes, I believe so."

The ear pauses, seeming to process the given information before responding, "So, what I'm hearing you say is that you're hearing me? Is that correct?" The ear asks.

"Yes."

"Good, I was hoping for that." The ear's flesh curls, seeming to smile.
