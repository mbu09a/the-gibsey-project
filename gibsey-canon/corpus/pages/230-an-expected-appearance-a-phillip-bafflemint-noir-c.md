"Where's the rest of you?" Philip asks the ear.

"I've been projected through space to help teach you to listen."

"To help me to listen?"

"Yes, you heard that correctly."

"What should I be listening for?"

"Put your ear to the ground. Maybe you'll find out."

Both the ear and Phillip are shrouded in darkness aside from a spotlight that peers down at them from above.

Phillip starts to lean over, ready to follow the ear's instructions, but he hesitates, holding himself back.

The ear continues, "Return to the earth. That's all you have to do. I listen. I'm always listening." The ear continues its hovering, the movement of its shape fragmenting the light into shards like a laser refracting off a dull and useless crystal.

"What can you hear right now?" Phillip asks the ear, curious.
