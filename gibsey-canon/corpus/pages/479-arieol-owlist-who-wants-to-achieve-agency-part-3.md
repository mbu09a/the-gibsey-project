And yes, it's true. Itt does remind them of that cannibalistic fantasy from earlier, but, no, no-NO!-wait! NO! That was not a fantasy! That was a nightmare! And only a nightmare! They're entirely sure of that, and so is this, this, this thing here that's speaking to them.

No, no, no, no, NO!

It can't be!

Most-magical-place-on-earth, my-ass!

This very much deserves a reversed reading!

This is what burn-out looks like ladies and gentlemen.

This is some Frankenstein-type-shit, John Henry-type-shit, Lamkin-type-shit, born of the depths and twittering to return to it, all fleshy and pruney like your fingers when you've lingered in the bath for too long, all lumped and knotted and twisted, tiny folds of skin folded atop themselves.

Please stop speaking.

Please.

I don't want to hear it again.

The boil makes these clicking, popping sounds when it talks, like a still born struggling to come to life.

It struggles to keep its eyes open, almost as if it's inebriated, like it's falling in and out of consciousness, like when the heroine's surging through to both finally provide and take away all of the best parts of yourself.

"Oh, Arieol, my sweet," It sputters and spits, "My dear one, how can you be so naive? Don't be so daft. Haven't you ever met a talking boil before? Be realistic here, Arieol. You're a telepathic, shape-shifting low-life, wandering around doing task-after-task for your betters, over and over again, all without sleep, warmth, rest, or even basic decency, and all in the putrefying hell of this nightmare-scape we call Gibsey World. You can't tell me you're really surprised that you're seeing me now, are you? Now, please. Make yourself useful. Be a good underling, Arieol, and stick it inside me. Stick it in me, really good, Arieol.
