Now, to be clear, being the astute reader that you are, it's likely that you've noticed that they-meaning the aforementioned character, The Author-that upon being referred to, or being named and identified, their name, The Author, is spelled with the use of proper capitalization which gives The Author a certain gravitas (however illusory this gravitas may be since they are, as has been mentioned and evident, an amateur), and so, being the astute reader that you are, you've likely inferred that this is the name with which they will be referred to for much of their unfolding narrative, or at least until a more appropriate one can be decided upon, or at least until who they are as a character is more definitively established within their narrative (or their myth)-exploration of identity being a purpose of many and most narratives, including both amateur writing and creation myths-and though this is true, there is also an additional idea which you, being the astute reader which you are, may have also noticed: when their name is (or was) capitalized in this way, meaning The Author, and by making this specific authorial choice, a risk has been taken that a dear and astute reader, such as yourself, could easily misconstrue as assuming too much, much like the earlier reference to this unfolding narrative as a creation myth itself could also be construed as assuming too much. However, by contrast, this idea of possibly assuming too much by calling an author The Author is less applicable within this specific case, rather than the previously provided example, because-and it may be important to note-I, myself, as an author, have not and will not be referring to myself as The Author, and I will instead be referring to myself as an author, meaning that when referring to myself within this unfolding narrative, I will not be capitalizing the beginning letters of my name, which I hope to be a different authorial choice than referring to the character as The Author, and to be even more clear about this specific authorial choice, I am doing so because I am attempting to make a distinction, to differentiate myself, to make clear that I am not the character in the story that's being referred to as The Author, and instead, that I am the writer of the narrative that's currently being constructed in medias res, and what this means then, in particular, is that, rather than reporting on the present, I am instead reporting on what has already occurred in the past, and therefore, in doing so, I am paradoxically speaking of the present in medias res, which means that by referring to The Author as The Author, I may not be, in fact, assuming too much, this being true, and even self-evidently true, because, as has already been seen through the process of refering to myself as an author rather than The Author, throughout this process, I have shown that I'm not wanting to come across as assuming too much, which admittedly and embarrassingly may instead be what is now occurring anyway since, through the process of doing so, I've clarified that specific point in real time, in medias res, which could instead make it seem to you, my dear and astute reader, that I am, in fact, assuming too much, this being due to the fact that I'm making these useless and self-contradictory clarifications-of which I am happy to admit-a fact that shouldn't come as a surprise to an astute reader such as yourself since this would then also show how this unfolding narrative is also being written by an amateur, meaning that I, myself, would be admitting to you, my dear and astute reader, in medias res, both in the writing itself and through the process of my writing, that I am not a very skilled writer at all and that I'm instead an amateur, an admission which can, hopefully, also serve to point out how my writing, the writing being constructed by an author rather than The Author, the writing being read by you, my dear and astute reader, how this narrative being constructed, in medias res, the writing which you are now reading, how amateurish it is, and therefore, as a piece of writing or text, that it isn't assuming too much due to its amateurish nature, if that hasn't already been established, or assumed, by you already, since you are an astute reader, after all.
