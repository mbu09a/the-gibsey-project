Jacklyn Variance, it's ok when you're not watching.

It's ok that you didn't always watch.

Who can?

And despite my own promises, my attention will also surely wander from time to time, as well.

I hope you can understand.

Didn't you know it was outside of your control?

What you said to them at the end?

All that you weren't aware of?

How could you have known?

I remembered when you told me.

I remember holding you.

You cried when you told me; you didn't want to end up like him.

The hospital.

Always returning to the hospital.

He was so lonely.

All you cared about is that you didn't want to end up like him.

You said it over and over again.

So lonely at the end.
