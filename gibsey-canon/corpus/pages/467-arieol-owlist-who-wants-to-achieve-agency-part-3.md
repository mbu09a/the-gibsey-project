Ahhhhhhhh.

Internal sigh of relief.

Before all this, Arieol used to have dreams, you know, if you can believe it, though they don't even remember what they were or are anymore, truth be told. Couldn't remember even if they tried. They were likely drowned out by either the stammering orders of these customers or Progresso's own voice (who it does sound like they've interrupted, which they do feel pretty good about; hopefully they can keep that up!). Damn, do they work Arieol hard, don't they? And this was why the thoughts within themselves, outside themselves were so essential: if it weren't for these, there'd be nothing left, no life to cling to, all there'd be is dirt and death below, not even a surface above with mourners to place their pretty little flowers down upon for those who will never even see the gifts they're being given, never even know they were there, but they're there, they're waiting, just above, come-on, come-on, you-can-do-it, stretch out that boney-little arm of yours through the splintering, splitting wooden scaffolding and reach through the dirt and mud and glass out from the surface to touch those vulnerable petals to your trembling fingertips.

And cling to them for as long as you can.

Ain't nothing wrong with it.

Nothing to be embarrassed by.

Hold them.

Hold them to yourself while you can.

And with enough time, you'll even get bored with the petals.

And the funny thing is, that's supposed to be the fun part.

Now this is really starting to get interesting!

And maybe it's not even phallic as much as it's-
