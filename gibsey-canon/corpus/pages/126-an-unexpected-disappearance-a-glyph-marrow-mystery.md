Of course, Glyph doesn't realize this at the time, at least not directly during the chapter. Well, and we all know it all already, and so does Glyph, he just doesn't know it yet. It's so easy to feel bad for the guy and his inability to connect, though. That was what stood out to me. He's a person of his time and place. He's terrified of the honesty of himself.

Yeah sure.

Please, ask away.

Is Gibseyan Mysticism a way we can be honest with ourselves?

Well, It can be, but it can just as easily be a way to be dishonest with ourselves. Really, it's probably either going to be dishonesty disguised as honesty or honesty disguised as dishonesty, and both ourselves and others may misunderstand the difference. It's like An Unexpected Disappearance in that way, like a work of fiction, I mean. It's not clear cut.

And well, if Glyph is going to grow in a later part of the novel, and if he's just beginning to learn in this section, maybe he always knew.
