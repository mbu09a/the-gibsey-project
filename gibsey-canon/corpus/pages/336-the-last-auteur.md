The rhythm picks up.

A train enters the scene.

Petey Puff, one of the classical Gibsey characters, you know, the comical part-human-part-pot-leaf doofus with glasses and a shrill voice-you've heard of him, I'm sure-hangs off the train as it's pulling up, emitting steam and light.

Petey Puff jumps down from it and into the scene in progress, clumsily tripping over themselves as they enter, their stammering voice interjecting into the choral group that's singing alongside them, narrating their entrance.

Petey Puff is comin', comin' down the track 'Hey, where the smoke is at? I need it for my back!'

This Petey Puff costumed cast member's playing this classic bumbling idiot, this fool, and they're playing them perfectly, stumbling around awkwardly, looking stoned as hell, not knowing where to go. It's fucking fantastic.

See him tokin', take it in his lungs, Look it, Puffy's stoned, Now he can't find home.
