"Actually, real quick. You got me thinkin'. Can't we also appropriate it? Use its own devices against itself?"

"We can certainly try, but it's yet to be determined. Like most corporate entities, it's extremely good at incorporating the things that resist it into its own structure. That's what a corporation does, after all. It's a group that acts as a singular body, not the reverse. The many become one rather than the one becoming many. They're all the absolute antithesis of personal expression and individuality, or I guess maybe of novelty, you could say. The thing is, the threshold has to be entered into alone, and a corporation can never enter anything alone, ever."

"Well, that's power for ya."

"But we have our own power, as well, don't we? Or devices, at least."

Arieol nods, lighting their cigar to take in another puff, to stir it in and around their breath and body before sending it back out. "But don't you think it's a little odd that you'd have all these new thematic considerations after this entity visited you? I mean hell, it sounds like it didn't just tap you on the shoulder. It flat out came inside you! Like, it inhabited you! Maybe it wants you to say and do these things just to grow itself even further? I don't mean to be a downer, but it seems mighty obsessed with colonization, Glyph. Doesn't sound to me like it'd go and give itself up."
