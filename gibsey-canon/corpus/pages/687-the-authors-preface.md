Opening Credits.

The Author stands and stares at the screens, at a set of screens, and the first thing they notice on the screens is a title, or a set of titles, or a series of accumulating titles, the same title, The Entrance Way: Into The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, which they realize is fitting as a title of the film they're watching since they live within an amusement park, after all, but there's a dim impression that something's not quite right, something's off with the screens, or within the screens, with the title, within the title.
