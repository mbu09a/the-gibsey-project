He's only felt this freaked out one other time this week, and even then, that experience also synchronistically matched this one.

He minimizes the chatbot, wanting to minimize it, to ignore it-it's starting to terrify him-and he pulls up his Substack, scrolling past it's heading-The Only Substantive, Subversive, and Substantially Sublime Substack-and-Podcast-Subscription where the Subconscious Mind Truly Subsists: The Sub-Zone-scrolling down to a post he added that week about a recent experience he went through right after since the branches had smashed through the window of his bathroom.

It felt synchronistically connected somehow.

Todd Fishbone had encountered an alien.

Or it wasn't an alien, necessarily.

It hadn't gone how he'd expected it to, at all.

At the time, he'd still yet to fix the window-he'd just fixed it yesterday, actually-which the branches had smashed through, which itself was sort of an odd position for a window since it had originally been installed high above the bathroom. What purpose had it even served?

And why do they even have windows in bathrooms at all, ever, really?

It doesn't make sense.

Isn't it supposed to be one's most private place?

But an odd location. or private space or not, the branches had smashed through, and when he'd recently gone to the restroom in the space before fixing it-there was no other way of saying it-he'd had an alien encounter.
