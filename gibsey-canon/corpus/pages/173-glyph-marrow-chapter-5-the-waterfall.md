The Author stops, pauses, and starts to laugh.

"You gotta be kidding me?"

"What?"

"You've been fucking with me!"

Shamrock Stillman smiles.

"Maybe."

"You've been fucking with me this whole time!"

"We always do."

"That's so funny."

"Yeah? I thought you'd appreciate it."

"I just-what? I still can't believe it."

"What?"

"I just still can't believe it. I just, I've really missed you, you know."

"I've missed you too."

"I just, I don't mean to repeat myself too much, but I just still can't believe it. You really got me for a little bit there. But I'm still struggling with a few things though, with the book, I mean, or the collection, or whatever it's become, or will become. I'm not even done with The Entrance Way yet. Can I just ask you a few more questions before you go? I'm not meaning to ask for too much when you've already come all this way."
