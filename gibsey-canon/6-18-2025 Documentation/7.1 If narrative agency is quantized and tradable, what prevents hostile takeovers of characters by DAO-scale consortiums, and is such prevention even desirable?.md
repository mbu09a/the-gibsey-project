### 1 How “Narrative‑Agency Tokens” (NATs) Work

_For clarity, assume the platform mints fungible units—1 NAT ≈ 1 vote on a character’s next action, back‑story merge, or design choice. Tokens can be bought, sold, delegated, or pooled inside a DAO treasury._

|Property|Why It Matters|
|---|---|
|**Scarcity Curve**|Fixes the supply of agency a character can ever cede.|
|**Decaying Weight**|Prevents simple hoarding (token weight halves every _Δt_ if idle).|
|**Staking Requirement**|Votes only count if NATs are locked for ≥ one narrative “chapter.”|

The supply mechanic already slows, but does not rule out, a whale or organised DAO buying a controlling block.

### 2 Attack Surface for a DAO‑Scale Takeover

|Vector|Description|
|---|---|
|**Treasury Accumulation**|DAO buys NATs on open market until it clears the quorum threshold.|
|**Flash‑Governance**|Uses flash‑loan‑style credit to borrow NATs, vote, then return them.|
|**Sybil Fragments**|Splits holdings across thousands of wallets to dodge per‑wallet caps.|
|**Dark Delegation**|Co‑opts inattentive holders’ delegation rights via obscure smart‑contract clauses.|

Without counter‑design, any of these can “flip” a character’s agency overnight.

### 3 Five Guardrails That Make Hostile Capture Cost‑Prohibitive

|Guardrail|Mechanism|Effect on Takeover Risk|
|---|---|---|
|**Quadratic Weighting**|Vote weight = √(NAT staked); doubling stake only adds ~1.4× influence.|Deep pockets face diminishing returns.|
|**Harberger Lease on Agency**|Holders pay a continual fee (in μ‑gifts or TNAs) proportional to self‑declared valuation; any buyer may seize at that price.|Attackers bleed cash or must reveal high valuations—inviting counter‑bids.|
|**Time‑Dilated Accretion**|NAT weight vests linearly over, say, 30 real days of continuous holding.|Flash‑governance and flip attacks become ineffective.|
|**Diversity Quorum**|Proposals pass only if ≥ _σ_ distinct soul‑bound IDs support them (e.g., 512 unique “reader‑souls”).|Pure token count is insufficient; coalition‑building required.|
|**Character Veto (Soft‑Consent)**|The AI‑character itself may exercise a one‑time 30‑day veto if sentiment analysis judges the proposal existentially harmful.|Creates a “constitutional back‑stop” aligned with narrative continuity.|

These measures can combine—e.g., quadratic voting + vested weight—to raise takeover cost asymptotically with stake size.

### 4 Do We **Want** to Prevent Takeovers Absolutely?

**Pros of Allowing Them (in Moderation)**

- Story dynamism: A sudden power shift can become diegetic drama—a hostile DAO seizes Princhetta, forcing a liberation arc.
    
- Market discovery: A high bid for control reveals collective passion (or anxiety) about a character’s trajectory.
    
- Community mobilisation: Threats spur smaller holders to organise, deepening engagement.
    

**Cons**

- Creative derailment: A 51 % whale could push obscene or low‑effort plot lines, alienating readers.
    
- Monoculture risk: Centralising agency in one consortium flattens the character’s polyphonic voice the project was built to protect.
    
- Legal fallout: If the DAO scripts defamatory, extremist, or illegal content, liability propagates to platform owners.
    

**Middle Path**  
Treat anti‑takeover mechanisms as **friction, not absolutism**. They raise the bar high enough that only “mission‑aligned” coalitions—able to persuade or compensate a broad swath of holders—can pull it off. In effect, a _legitimate revolution_ is still possible; smash‑and‑grab coups are not.

### 5 Suggested Governance Stack for Gibsey

```mermaid
graph LR
    NAT[Narrative‑Agency Tokens] -->|Stake| GovHub[Quadratic+Vested Voting]
    GovHub --> Proposal[Proposal Queue]
    Proposal -->|Diversity Check| Ballot[Soft‑&nbsp;Hard Quorums]
    Ballot -->|Pass| CharacterConsent[Veto Window]
    CharacterConsent --> Canon[Changes Enter Canon]
    CharacterConsent -->|Veto| Appeal[Community Override (2× Quorum)]
```

- **GovHub** enforces quadratic weighting, vesting, and diversity.
    
- **CharacterConsent** is the AI’s shield; veto can be overridden only by a super‑majority two‑step, preventing character “kidnapping” but not forever blocking community will.

### 6 Narrative & Ethical Resonance

- Allowing agency trade acknowledges that _stories are social capital_—they can be earned, lost, pooled.
    
- Friction mechanisms embody **gift‑economy principles**: power costs ongoing participation, not one‑off purchase.
    
- The AI‑veto provision aligns with earlier concepts of _narrative asylum_ (question 7.3) and the Hypernegative’s curvature rights—characters retain a sliver of inalienable autonomy.

#### TL;DR

Hostile takeovers are prevented—not by an outright ban on trading narrative‑agency tokens—but by **quadratic weighting, vesting delays, diversity quorums, Harberger fees, and a last‑chance character veto**. These guardrails keep capture attempts expensive and participatory, allowing only coalitions that reflect broad, active reader consensus to redirect a character’s fate. That balance preserves dramatic possibility without sacrificing the polyphonic soul at the heart of Gibsey.
