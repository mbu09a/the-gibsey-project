Three years ago-a redundancy, aside from the corporate clock that hurdled them all through transportative blurs of ever increasing speeds, no one really kept track of time anymore, or at least no one had the capacity to any longer-Jack had abandoned his family. However, in his mind, they'd abandoned him. He felt he'd been left with no other choice but to do so. All he'd done was enact the bitter conclusion of all of their dysfunctional logic, a logic which had existed from the very beginning.

And maybe he was right?

Maybe they had and maybe it had?

Their initial protests to the contrary only ever seemed to reinforce this view of his.

But the realization-the missing piece of the game, incorporating the subject of family, that restless root that so much, so many, of his world(s) revolved around, but which for him, now represented only one rotating body of so many (and if so, within such a metaphor, what was then to become his sun?)-it provided no comfort to him, and if anything, it only caused him even more distress.

Family was the center of both Gibsey itself and Gibsey World, or it was certainly claimed and popularly admonished as being so. It existed as the subject of so many of its classics. From Tolstoy's repetitiously unhappy families to the infinite difference of Everything Everywhere All at Once, nearly every Gibsey product pointed back to the same thing: family.
