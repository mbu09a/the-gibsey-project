**An Unexpected Disappearance** **Chapter 4- The Flooded Town**

Natalie Weissman, the well known professor, author, Gibstorian, and scholar of Gibseyan Mysticism, stands before the packed lecture hall of her recent Gibstory course, Gibstory, Gibseyan Mysticism, and the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad Ride, which has just returned from Spring Break.

Welcome back.

Welcome, welcome.

It's good to see you all again.

I always forget how many of you there are.

I hope all of your breaks were restful.

It looks like there's a few more of us still coming in.

OK, well, yes.

Let's go ahead and get started.

I'm going to be doing things a little bit differently today.
