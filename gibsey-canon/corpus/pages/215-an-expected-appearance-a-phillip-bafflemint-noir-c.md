Phillip had actually been at home with the flu, at the time.

The two hadn't been close-Phillip's life being set to a 3 at all times, he wasn't really close with anyone-so although Phillip had visited the funeral and still missed the poor son-of-a-bitch from time-to-time, the weirdness of it was more that he hadn't been with Murphy when it had happened, less that it had happened to begin with.

It had been the strangest thing for Phillip.

One day you're here, and another day, you're just not anymore.

He couldn't shake it.

At the funeral, seeing the body of the man sitting in a coffin whom he'd worked with for the last 3 years, it had felt so strange to him.

He didn't understand it.

Murphy had also seemed pleasant sitting in the coffin, almost seemed awake, like he was just taking a nap, and that he'd be back in Phillip's car headed for a new case the next morning. But months passed, and Phillip was still waiting on a partner to be newly assigned to him, let alone for Murphy to return. His working alone for these last few months had always seemed symbolic somehow. He'd gotten used to doing most things alone and figured he could keep this up if need be.

But things still felt off.

Not above level 3, of course, but off, nonetheless.
