But I know that I know that something is happening to me.

I know because I'm experiencing it.

I was a completely functional person before.

I was able to see things and identify them as things.

Now I can't do that anymore.

Maybe that's all that needs to be said?

Maybe there's nothing more to it than that?

Since I've had to live with it, I know the exact difference.

I know because I was there.

I was there when it all happened.

I was there when my life changed forever.

I was there when everything became a word, and everything stayed an object, and both existed at the same time.

And I can't go back.
