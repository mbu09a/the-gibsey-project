Underperforming Publications and Financial Losses

An Expected Appearance: a Phillip Bafflemint Noir

Loss: (Redacted) Notes: Initial interest waned quickly, leading to poor sales, likely due to the prevalence of other successful mystery and detective narratives such as An Unexpected Disappearance. Both critics and audience cited a lack of "realism" regarding the plot and characters.

Princhetta Who Thinks Herself Alive

Loss: (Redacted) Notes: Failed to resonate with readers, significantly underperforming expectations. Focus groups and audience surveys spoke to a lack of a "human voice" within the narrative.

Arieol Owlist Who Wants to Achieve Agency

Loss: (Redacted) Notes: Marketed aggressively but received lukewarm reception and poor sales, likely due to the narrative's overblown style, inconsistency, and its thematic repetition of themes of oppression, singular agency, and (some critics suggest) the subtext of legal failure and disillusionment.
