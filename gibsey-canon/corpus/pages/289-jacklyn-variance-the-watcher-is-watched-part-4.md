And there was one more thing Jacklyn knew which she hadn't observed in most other agents, or which she at least hadn't seen just yet, maybe it would always be there, all along once she found it--it often is, maybe even always is, sitting there, waiting to be found by a willing observer-her key insight being that perception is essential to the experience, at least for any analyst worth their salt, because it's what animates the observation itself, what makes it uniquely hers, or theirs, and therefore what makes it a truly observed piece of analysis. Anyone can observe facts, list data, and repeat information. The agency has machines, clones, and intelligences of both artificial and extended means, as well as a few types yet-to-be-named since they're still in the process of their own development, all dedicated to collecting factual data of this kind at an increasingly rapid rate, feeding it back into itself, and multiplying. This was a theme park civilization built on the shoulders of the American empire, after all, shoulders that had been buckled down by the size and weight of all that had been collected from the very beginning. No, what they need, or needed, what the essential and competent analyst must always attempt, is to perceive, and upon perceiving, they would then transform the environment of their world.
