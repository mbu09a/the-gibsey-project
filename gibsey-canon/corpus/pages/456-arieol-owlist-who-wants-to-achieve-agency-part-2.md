So The Author chooses.

They choose to finish this letter.

They choose to investigate further.

They choose to assert themselves.

They choose to exist.

They choose to write.

They choose to hope.

They choose to continue.

Not because they're certain these choices are meaningful.

Not because they're certain these choices are real.

Not because they're certain they exist to make choices.

But because making choices feels better than not making choices.

Because hoping feels better than despairing.

Because continuing feels better than stopping.

Because writing feels better than silence.

Because questioning feels better than accepting.

Because doubting feels better than false certainty.

Because agency, even illusory agency, feels better than powerlessness.

And so The Author will practice agency.

They will practice choice.

They will practice hope.

They will practice existence.

They will practice authorship.

Not because they know it will work.

But because trying feels better than not trying.

Because attempting feels better than accepting.

Because fighting feels better than surrendering.
