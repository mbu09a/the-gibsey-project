Not if I'm going to get the budget cut which is the real reason why I'm there, on set, why I'm willing to be there, even as CEO of this whole thing.

And the budget of this thing.

My fucking god.

That was the real spectacle of it all.

You really should've seen it, should've been there, on set, to see it, as it was all happening.

There may have even been an actual goddamn golden age, and you know what?

That golden age?

It's fucking now.

This set he's gotten them to build, I mean, that he's gotten me to build, goddamnit-it's pretty much a full scale replica of the park entrance way of The Magical Dominion park, down to the smallest detail. It's as accurate as it could possibly be. A full simulation of the original. Down to the letter.

It might even be better than the original, could replace the original if it needed to, not that it ever will.

And you can see it, being in that landscape.

It's undeniable.

It's like you're really there.
