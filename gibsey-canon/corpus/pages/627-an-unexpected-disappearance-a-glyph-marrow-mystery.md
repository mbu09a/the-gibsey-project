He stumbles out of his Bungalow and past the bleached sands of the resort to board the Diarail. Heads to the Magical Dominion to stand before the sculpted artificial peeks of the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument ride.

Their eyes.

Their cheeks.

The slope of their face.

Nothing.

All is just a gray blur.
