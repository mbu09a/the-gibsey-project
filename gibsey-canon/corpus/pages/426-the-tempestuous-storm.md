She remembers a sun and moon, the image on the wind chimes carved into that plane of bent metal (or was it bronze?), all silvery and gold (or was it golden and silver?) which held the chimes aloft and protected them all from falling to earth, enabled them to clapse together into those organal voices of chimes, voices which could morph into the singular noise of the evening's blistering cicadas or air-conditioned hum, at least if one didn't stop and focus one's hearing on their individual letters and twitch their singaled noise into words.

Or was the sun her first memory? And the moon second? Or first?
