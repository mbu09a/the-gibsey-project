But maybe externalities were bound to present themselves within such an arrangement, and Jacklyn Variance is about to notice one, the image of herself coming on screen as Parlance enters the darkness of the theater, walking subtly behind him, to halt in front of the image of herself, to see the image of herself, there in the dark, standing, not to see the image of herself, but watching a different version of herself, not one she remembers, or was it even a different version of herself or her same self?

Or she considers another possibility, is this some glimpse into a future event?

She's read many Data Reports on the sensation of deja vu, an anomaly of memory whereby one's recollection or sensation is centered around some sort of dreamed or not-quite-conscious experience that somehow remains sensed or processed as conscious despite its unconscious origin, defying one's sense of possibility. And like most experiences, this could happen at any time, at any point in someone's life, even at a younger age. And this is true, as Jacklyn remembers, if the memory is correct, a time in grade school, staring at her desk, convinced that her pencil was at an angle she'd seen before which existed outside of everyday reality, and her backpack had been there, as well, when she'd seen it, and the sound of her teacher's voice trailing off about some mathematical idea she suddenly didn't have the attention for. Why did it strike her with such familiarity? This sensation also could be induced, according to her training, still ongoing, of course, and agents were often encouraged to search out and attempt to consciously repeat this process regularly (if this process was, in fact, induced consciously, data analysts are still divided on the subject).
