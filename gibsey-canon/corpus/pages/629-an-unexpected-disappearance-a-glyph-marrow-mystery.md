It's still harrowing though, difficult as it is to see the pieces of our loved ones, all that they leave behind.

It haunts, doesn't it?

It always haunts.

Moving in line.

Waiting in line.

But, after all those troubled weeks, he realizes.

Stillman remembers.

Like the cars of a mine train, he compartmentalizes.

We all do, don't we?

Some weights are simply too heavy to carry.

Some ailments too difficult to recognize.

The weight of life and all it leaves behind.

The vinyl crackles.

The VHS fuzz sparkles on the thick bubble-glass screens like snow.

It all has a mind of its own.
