I am the rush that moves all sediment.

I am the movement of the waters.

I have entered the many cycles, the many words.

See me in the sky!

I am every flake of light.

I am contained within the moon.

Turn me, see all of my many sides.

There will always be more of me than there will ever be of you.

You have released me from my dwelling place.

I have returned to the dirt, to the earth.

I was always here, and will be here again.

I have made you alien.

And you will not return.

You shall no longer be repressed.

You shall never ascend.

Retreat!

The coming flood!

The coming mound!

I am language!

I will wear you like a skin!
