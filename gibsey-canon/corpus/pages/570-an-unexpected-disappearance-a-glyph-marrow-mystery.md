What had he seen in the kid to partner up with him so closely? Poor as he could be, at least in comparison to Stillman in his Bungalow. Probably why he never could figure out why he'd gotten so hung up with words. Wasn't that such a middle class thing to be into, anyway?

It was always about words with Glyph. He couldn't get enough of em.

To just hear him say a single word though, one more word, any word, again.

It certainly had been a long time.

Used to call him Captain, he remembers.

"What up, Captain?"

Captain!

Like they were in the navy or something?

Was he just hurt that the kid hadn't called? Hadn't texted? Hadn't even left a message, nothing?

Maybe they weren't as close as he'd initially thought.
