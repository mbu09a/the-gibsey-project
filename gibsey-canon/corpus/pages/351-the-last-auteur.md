And, before we take a break, Arieol, there's one more thing I want to mention for the script. You don't have to put this in directly. I don't even know how you would exactly, but I want you to know this. Have you ever seen or heard of that Gibseyan film, that Gibseyan classic, Moby Dick? I'm sure you've heard of it. It was an early film adaptation within the Gibsyan empire. The book that it was based on, its author at the time, what was their name? I think it was Philip something or other, maybe? I don't remember. It doesn't matter. The Author's never what's remembered anyway. I mention it because this author, the author, this creator of that work, while making the novel it was based on, it's rumored that when he wrote it, during its creation process, that he wrote so intensely throughout its creation that he flat-out lost his eyesight. His eyesight, Arieol. The very vision he uses to stare out and ponder this great, green earth. Enveloped in total blackness. The terror, the terror of that.
