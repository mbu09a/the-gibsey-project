Upon writing this exact passage for you, my dear and astute reader, I've also still yet to find out for certain whether this narrative, or my own life, is to be cut from the light of life as if by the blade of Oren Progresso himself. Whether a flatulent odor that only I'm the one to ever smell, or The Biggest Shit of All Time, only time and fate-the x and y axis (let alone the z)-will tell.

All this is to say, although it may seem strange for Phillip Bafflemint to snap into position with such a furious fervor, there is a precedent for such dream-like, risky, absurd, ridiculous, and beautifully self-delusional behaviors and positions, including the life of an author who, like Phillip, organized a similar collection in a similar manner.

The sub-and/or-unconscious mind has a mind of its own.

Sometimes it taps you on the shoulder, and other times it kicks you straight up the behind with a steel-toed boot.

And already ass-bruised from such a steel toe, as Phillip's organizing all those piling papers into stacks, he stops and notices a symbol, a set of symbols, a set which has already started cranking the leg backward again, catapult style, to swing forward, ready for Round Two.

The symbols seemed to radiate a dark and sinister secret.

He could immediately tell they weren't just a random set of doodles, either.

They could maybe even be a whole new language.
