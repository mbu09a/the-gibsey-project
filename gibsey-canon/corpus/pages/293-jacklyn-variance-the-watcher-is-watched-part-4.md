Preston was a filmmaker, notorious for never completing any of the projects he'd wanted to complete.

His entire existence was a cutting room floor, so much so that he never got around to making the masterpieces everyone knew that he could've made.

If he had, the world itself wouldn't have known what hit it.

Nothing could have prepared it.

Nothing.

And of course, that's why it'd been so hard for him to finish and so hard for everyone else knowing what would now forever be fated to be withheld from their world.

Days before, she'd talked to him on the phone quite a bit actually, a little bit more than normal, but not in any sort of way that seemed out of the ordinary. They talked on the phone quite often, after all, so she hadn't thought it out of the ordinary.

How could she have known?

Did she?

Did Preston?

Of the many details, the data, the facts observed secondarily, which she remembers constantly and repetitively now, from those talks, the most important detail, or the one which has stuck with her the most, was the title of a film Preston said he'd wanted to make.

"Splitter."
