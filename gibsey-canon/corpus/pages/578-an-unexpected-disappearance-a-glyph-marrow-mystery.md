And wasn't a geyser itself a symbol of excess? They were made up of the interplay of 3 elements, heat, pressure, and water, or a single element, energy. Underground, water seeps into porous rock, coming into contact with magma chambers which heat up the water. As the water heats up, like this theme park civilization of theirs, it wants to expand-mind of its own-but confined by the rock and overlying water, it can't, and so the pressure builds and builds until a critical point, a climax, where the water bursts forth, ascends into spectacular eruption. And after such an ascension, the water falls, dissipates, seeps back into the chamber, and the geyser system resets to repeat the cycle anew. In the case of the painting, there were six artificially constructed geysers, starting with the primary colors-red, yellow, and blue-and then the secondary-orange, purple, and green. How had the colors not mixed into a grayish blob?
