Of course it's crossed his mind that this house wasn't his to have entered, that it was questionably flooded, that he was a detective here to investigate a disappearance, and all this had very little to do with the case in question, and would shed light on nothing if not very little, and thus, that putting himself in such a position wasn't just risky, but was flat out absurd.

And to interrupt my dear and astute reader-I apologize in advance for breaking this fourth-great wall to speak with you directly within one of the already very few (supposedly) realistic sections to have danced its way across our shared field of vision thus far, throughout this torn and tangled collection- but you may remember back in the first chapter, "an author's preface," that I'd claimed to be a sort-of Scheherazade in reverse. During this section, I'd explained that this meant that, rather than telling a long and convoluted story to keep myself from being killed only to find out later that I was to be protected, that I was telling a long and convoluted story that I would either be killed for telling, or that I would kill myself while creating -not suicidally, mind you, or at least if so, don't tell my therapist-and also not because of the difficulty of the task, but instead because all this twisted time and effort could be put in, and even if it ended up magical, redemptive, and sublimely beautiful, the corporate company I was thus satirizing could always just swoop down like a hawk with a hammer in its claws and squash any chance at these ideas being published like, well, like the moth Phillip was previously compared to. They do not fuck around with copyright. (Look it up!) For all I knew, and still know (or don't know), I could end up in the jaws of a gator at the bottom of Bay Lake! But again, this thought also came to me (or still comes to me, continually) that I was (or am) a Scheherazade in reverse, that rather than telling a story to save my own skin, that I was (and am) telling a story that could kill me, or a story which itself could be killed by the corporate conglomerate company in question, only to find out later that I had nothing to be afraid of to begin with, or so I, as an author, could only hope.
