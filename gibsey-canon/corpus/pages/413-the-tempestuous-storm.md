She doesn't know this, but she's missed an important email informing her of a Tempestuous Storm.

Her first class of the semester, the class for which she's about to leave her office to teach in just a few minutes, has been relocated due to such an incoming disaster.

This and other disasters have become increasingly ubiquitous for this region of the park complex, if not all regions of the park complex.

And it's the first day of the new semester.

Natalie's nervous, though with her many years of experience-or with the many years of experience which once existed within a cloned version of herself and which has now been partially programmed into her skipping mind through some kind of ruinous technological magic-she at least no longer has to take trips to the restroom to vomit into a stall.

She's tense, alert, and hyper-vigilant, but she's handling it.

Natalie doesn't care about her lack of make-up, never really cared for it or used it as often as others, and instead twists her hair into a tight, low-maintenance bun. She wears small, wire frame glasses, the kind you'd find on a librarian or boy-wizard of a popular Gibseyan franchise. She grits her teeth and glances at her phone to see if the time has come for her to leave for the first class of the semester. She wants to leave and enter the classroom with enough time to prepare, but not with so much time that she has to interact with her new students. She's more comfortable with her classes than her un-cloned self had been before, but there's no need to be that comfortable, certainly not on the first day of class.

But then the time comes, as it always does, to leave the office, and head toward the first day of class.
