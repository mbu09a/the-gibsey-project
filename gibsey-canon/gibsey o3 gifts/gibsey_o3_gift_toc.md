# Gibsey o3 Gifts Table of Contents

This Obsidian-friendly table of contents is designed for use with Canvas. Each gift below should be linked to its own dedicated page using `[[Gift Name]]` notation. Suggestions for structuring your vault and how to use the links are included at the end.

## Gift Quick Reference Table

|#|What it is|Why you probably don‚Äôt have it yet|Deliverables|Attach-point|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|[[SREC ‚Äì Symbol-Rotation Embedding Compiler Alt]]|Messy/unstable vector anchors for 64 Corpus orientations|Python module, Chroma DB storage, audit log|After SVG upload, before Cassandra|
|2|[[QDRG ‚Äì Quad-Directional Reflex Graph Scheduler]]|QDPI actions handled step-by-step, no reflex logic|YAML DSL, TypeScript service, Kafka integration|Node/Hono sidecar, listens on Kafka|
|3|[[LNAP ‚Äì Latent Narrative Auto-Patcher]]|Manual prose/config fixes for paradox tickets|Prompt-engineering template, DSPy Select module|Kicks off from ‚Äúparadox ticket‚Äù webhook|
|4|[[GAL ‚Äì Gift Amplification Ledger]]|No additive ledger for TNAs|Postgres schema, Rust microservice, batch job|Between Vault writer and event log|
|5|[[SDD ‚Äì Symbolic Dream Diffuser]]|‚ÄúDream‚Äù output drifts from symbol intent/colorway|Constraint grammar, DSPy Guard wrapper|Wraps every `dream.generate()` call|
|6|[[NTCI ‚Äì Narrative-Time-Crystal Index]]|No periodicities/echo patterns surfaced in Vault|Python job for periodicity/self-similarity, annotations|Daily cron, writes to Cassandra tags|

## Canvas Structuring Suggestions

- **Central Node:** Use this TOC as the central node.
    
- **Individual Pages:** Each gift links out to a dedicated note (with code, setup, and instructions). E.g., `[[SREC ‚Äì Symbol-Rotation Embedding Compiler]]` links to your implementation note.
    
- **Attach-points:** For each gift, cross-link to your architecture notes or relevant Obsidian sections, like `[[Cassandra Pipeline]]`, `[[Vault System]]`, etc.
    
- **Integration Roadmap:** Optionally, create a Canvas cluster/section for "Integration Roadmap" to track which gifts are installed, in-progress, or planned.

## Example ‚Äì SREC Note Skeleton

```md
# SREC ‚Äì Symbol-Rotation Embedding Compiler

## What it is
Stable, deterministic vector embedding compiler for the 64 possible Corpus symbol orientations.

## Why you probably don‚Äôt have it yet
Manual vector tuning is error-prone and drifts over time.

## Deliverables
- Python module (hashes, rotates, embeds, stores in Chroma DB)
- Deterministic ID generation for stability
- Cosine-distance audit log

## Attach-point
After SVG upload, before pushing vectors to Cassandra.

## Setup Instructions
_To be filled in after importing the bundle._
```

## Optional: Status/Progress Table

|Gift|Status|Integration Notes|
|---|---|---|
|SREC ‚Äì Symbol-Rotation Embedding Compiler|Installed|‚úÖ Stable, in Chroma DB|
|QDRG ‚Äì Quad-Directional Reflex Graph|In Progress|Need Kafka test|
|...|...|...|

**Tip:**

- You can embed this table in Canvas, then drag arrows between nodes for visual status.
    
- Use `[[Back to o3 Gifts TOC]]` at the top of each gift note for navigation.
    
- As you re-import bundles, drop implementation/code below the corresponding note.

Let me know if you want:

- Prebuilt note skeletons for each gift
    
- Canvas JSON for visual layout
    
- Tagging/metadata strategies for Vault discovery
    

Or any tweaks to naming/structure!
