He laughs at the ridiculousness of this idea, clicking through files on his computer, his rolling chair squeaking, his laughter shifting to sudden bursts of rage when the internet cuts in and out for no reason-it's been doing this a lot lately and he doesn't know why--man-child screams of,"Why can't you just work already!?"

He dreams of being a game developer, and he's always trying to think of ways he can add new content to the game he's coding, wants to add in the unexpected, even what he himself wouldn't expect to happen somehow. And that's what the players want, the constantly new. Newer and newer content for audiences never content. But our fate-and this is something that all games and gamers know all too well, games being nothing else but expressions of fate-is to always want the opposite of what we have at any given time, and so at such a time, when every desire is continually accessible, what is there left to desire? Is desire even possible in such an environment?

Pile it all on, all that endlessly cranked out content, pile it onto the shit pile that no one even has the time anymore to smell, let alone identify the smell of, even when words describing the shit pile are located, pruned, set into type-faced symmetrical poems that could loosen the tightest nun in the convent, if no one has the time to read them, what did it matter?

But all they had was time.

So where was the time going?

Where was it always disappearing off to?
