"Are you OK?" She's gotten entirely distracted from the situation at hand, the case, Manny's disappearance, which they were discussing and seems to have gone on some social-emotional tangent, but with her sudden shift in tone and seriousness, he doesn't want to stop her and return to the case too quickly. If anything, he feels bad for her, senses she's struggling with something important. It feels like she's been hired to give a performance and she's now just going through the motion. It's as if she has the words memorized, but the feeling behind them is now gone. What had happened to her to cause such a change? What had she said? Something about mixing the scientific and the religious? Subjectivity and objectivity? Or was it reality and fiction? And did it have something to do with the disappearance of Manny Valentinas?

Or wait, what about London Fox?

"But-" She continues on as if he'd never even asked if she was OK, "But how are we going to better our situations if they're always one-sided, and we're always the ones footing the bill? Surely that's a lot of pressure to place on individuals, wouldn't you say, darling?" She brightens back up a bit, though she's staring at him with less mirthful compassion and warmth this time around. The look she's now giving off appears more understanding towards herself, more attentive.
