Parlance pauses in his writing. This is the moment where it especially seems as if he may be contemplating whether or not he has become the real and current subject of the film. He looks up, lost in thought, playing with the end of his mechanical pencil, screwing it off and on again. Lead accidentally spills out. He gathers it up off the floor and puts it back into the pencil.

Is this a moment of improvisation?

How much is he aware of?

He smiles.

An action such as this seems too obvious not to be an unintentional one, though interviews with other Cast Members familiar with Parlance, in particular, have revealed that he's known for his absentmindedness, flights of fancy, digressions, insecurity, indecisiveness, a lack of focus and awareness, that he's unable to stay on any given subject for an extended period of time, that-for example-his being under investigation as a possible SUBversive agent is entirely unknown to him, and many even think it suspicious that he works as a writer and data analyst for A.D.D., let alone that the focus has shifted to him within the film entirely, while the narrative is still unfolding, that he may even be in the process of becoming a major character.

This has already ignited the social networks, though being constantly unaware of so many things, Jack is unaware of this.
