"That's fucking ridiculous! And you know what? I want my own device I can return to throughout my own little monologues you little-Give me that!" Glyph grabs the cigar out of Arieol's hand and brings it to their mouth to take a shallow puff. They do so poorly, leading to a coughing fit. Arieol erupts with laughter.

"Well it got your fire lit, didn't it? Everybody's so terrified of reality these days. Who gives a shit about a little gas. So the coastlines shift. You'll live! The cigars yours, have at it. If anything, I'd say it's a sign of your ascension."

The cart lurches forward again.

"Huh?" Arieol nods, "And here I was thinking it was just a cigar? And they're gonna tell me all I ever do is tell rather than show? You're almost as bad as Fukayama!"

They pass the Billy Goat with the stick of dynamite in its mouth, that symbol of Pan, according to Arieol at least-Arieol sees pagan, folk, and mystically ritual traditions all over this damn landscape-and the cart continues its climb up the Second Ascent.
