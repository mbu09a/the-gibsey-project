**An Unexpected Disappearance:A Glyph Marrow Mystery** **Chapter 5- The Waterfall**

The Author leashes their dogs up to take them outside for their every-couple-of-hours potty break only to waltz right back inside. It's pouring rain. What a fucking waste of their fucking time.

So much feels like a waste of time, these days, for The Author, anyway.

They place the leashes back down on the counter and glance up at the windows of the living room to see how they'd missed the vital info of the weather before exiting, and yep, the window panes do, in fact, seem filled with the darkening blueness and staccato of falling droplets typical of such weather.

Another repeated reminder of how their daily observational skills weren't as developed as they could or should be.

But hey, they'd been observant enough not to walk out of the apartment and get completely soaked, heard the pounding of the droplets on the pavement, witnessed the dripping awnings and terraces, the many puddles forming, and had proceeded to process this data, and turn right around back inside to the dry safety of their apartment.
