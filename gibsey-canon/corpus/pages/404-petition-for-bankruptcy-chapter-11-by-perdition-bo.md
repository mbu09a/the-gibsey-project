Conclusion

In light of these legal challenges and their operational ramifications, The Debtor finds itself in a position where reorganization under Chapter 11 is not only prudent but necessary. This filing is an essential step in addressing the complex legal and financial landscape we face and laying the groundwork for a sustainable future in the rapidly evolving world of publishing and technology. In addition to this, Perdition Books would also like to argue that its company is not the only company that currently should be filing for bankruptcy, as such. If anything, Gibseyan society itself is responsible and should file for bankruptcy in a similar manner, as a whole. This is the issue at the heart of many of the controversies of the failed Cop-E-Right legal case. In a world where corporations themselves have legal personhood, how absurd would it be, really, for AIs to be given such forms of representation? And if both such legal representations are thus easily put into question, what does this tell us about the legal frameworks which "invisibly" organize Gibseyan society? How can we continue to accept such precedents? Is our world not one which we create for ourselves? And as such, are laws simply a way to outsource our own personal responsibilities in the same way that we now outsource human creativity to AI? Whether or not the absurdity of these ideas should be taken into full consideration, none can argue that the increasing failure of our created systems are anything but bankrupt, corrupt, and unjustly skewed towards reinforcing the power of the specific individual rather than the collective good. Although Cop-E-Right's case was an absurd failure, what else is to be said of this world we created which we call wonderful, and which we could recreate, or remake, at any given time?
