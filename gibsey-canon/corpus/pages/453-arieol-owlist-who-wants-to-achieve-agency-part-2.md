And maybe that trying is enough.

Maybe that trying is everything.

Maybe that trying is what separates characters from authors, even when the characters are authors and the authors are characters.

Maybe that trying is what creates agency out of powerlessness, meaning out of meaninglessness, reality out of fiction.

Or maybe not.

Maybe The Author is deluding themselves.

Maybe this letter is just another form of transcription, another way of recording someone else's thoughts.

Maybe their investigation is just another plot point in someone else's story.

Maybe their search for agency is just another way of demonstrating their lack of agency.

But even if that's true, even if The Author is deluding themselves, the delusion feels better than the alternative.

The delusion feels like hope.

The delusion feels like possibility.

The delusion feels like life.

And if life is a delusion, then The Author chooses the delusion.

If agency is an illusion, then The Author chooses the illusion.

If meaning is a construction, then The Author chooses to construct it.

Because the alternative is unbearable.

Because despair is unbearable.

Because meaninglessness is unbearable.
