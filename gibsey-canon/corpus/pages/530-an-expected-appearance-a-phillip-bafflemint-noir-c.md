There was a name he saw come up a few times, a name he assumed Manny Valentinas had given to the park, rather than London Fox-unsure where this assumption came from, could've just been pure intuition: Walt Disney World.

Walt Disney World.

He'd never heard it before coming to Thanatos Drive, and isn't sure what to think of it.

As he drives home, he can feel his hands shaking as he grips the steering wheel.

What's wrong with him?

Was it the name he'd seen?

But what did it matter?

Had Judy been trying to get him wrapped up in some legal battle with Gibsey or something?

Or would her suggestions and encouragement prove fruitful?

The more and more that he thought back to their conversion, the more everything felt like a hall of mirrors.
