And so I'm on this set with Scrillio's ears turning red, and he's yelling "cut" like he's Sleeping Beauty coming awake for the first time, and it's the only word she can fucking remember.

But I have no sympathy for him.

None.

I really don't.

Not a fucking molecule.

I told him explicitly when he came to us to pitch this fucking project of his, I told him, remaking his first film, which already was an adaptation of an epic poem from an obscure and reclusive author whose identity has yet to be fully revealed, one that we're still attempting to locate, was not going to go well, especially during the production process, and especially while all the recent disasters and traumas have been occurring and re-occuring all around the park, but he didn't listen, did he?

Are you getting all this?

"Yessir, every word," Arieol answers him.

Good. Oh, and Arieol, do me a favor. Please make an especially clear note of what I've just said, so that whenever the idiot that's going to write my supposed biography says I was churning out prestige pictures that failed miserably at the box office, all under my watch, that the world can see what was really going on. Goddamn biographers make me sick. Can't even build a legacy themselves. Have to suck away at the lives of others, bleeding us dry, the leeches, blood-sucking vampires, every last one of them.

But I digress.

Back to the script.
