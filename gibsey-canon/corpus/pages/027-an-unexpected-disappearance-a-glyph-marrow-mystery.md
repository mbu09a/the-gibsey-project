I'm just now even realizing that this is my home wherein I live: the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride.

How could I have not realized or wondered about this before?

Like I said, my life is simple, minimally simple, and because of this simplicity, details slip my mind, from time to time. I'm sure it's something you've experienced yourself. You've woken up, not remembering where you are, as if your identity and self has been stripped bare, disintegrated, demolished, like a defunct attraction, like an unexpected disappearance. It's certainly possible that it's just the nature of my ailment, and my ailment alone, but I can only assume that there's something to it that someone out there can relate to.

And that's not all that I'm missing, it would seem. I also don't have a job, let alone a name. At least not that I'm aware of. Or if I do, then I've forgotten them. But somehow, this fact doesn't bother me. And should it?
