They remember the opening shot of Blue Velvet, another Gibseyan classic, the camera panning down, underground, underneath, into the dirt, into the ground, the earth, the ants scurrying. There's a darkness beneath the earth. They often forget this. All they feel is blank, black, existential mirth, lying there, bathed under blankets of sunlight and shadow, dazed, blinking, purple-blue-orange-red light, dots of stars scattering underneath their eyelids, under the backyard and over the backyard, together, both, elated.

This experience overwhelms them.

Their partner comes and lays down next to them.

Blue hair, softness of skin, dead, digging, dirt below.

They're truly more content than they've been in a long time.

The backyard landscape, this backyard landscape, is like a window, is like a screen, is like an image that's laid beneath a frame.

It's a hunger.

They love their dogs.

Ferris, their half-poodle-half-terrier, comes up to them, now that they're on the same level, ground-level, and licks their faces. Posey, their white schnauzer, sniffs around the backyard, searching for new smells and experiences.

The Author feels as if they've dreamed this all before.

And maybe they have, or did, or will.
