Another bus sigh as it jolts down to the next curb. Bodies pile out and click onward toward their destinations like blood cells rushing to capillaries. Circular and circulatory, he buys himself popcorn and a large drink.

Indications of his exorbitant spending on the habits of entertainment, at least exorbitant with the context of his salary in comparison to hers-the agent following him doesn't just best him regarding amount, but where she places said funds, where it's transported in the body of her financial intentions, the neural pathways she's carved out for herself; he has no financial intentions other than what he wants then and there at any given moment, and his debts just grow and grow- his ever-growing debts, shackles of commerce, butter and salt, sugary sweetness, images of ice peeling down sides of cups, images colder and more refreshing than the overpriced cardboard you slip into the circular cup holder to face the light, but he isn't there yet, she's still watching him waiting in line, always waiting in line, the piling bodies, the images, the moving images.

Even though she typically tries to be a passive observer, even she's a bit hyped at what image he'll find on the screen. Will it be himself? Will he have been able to catch himself in time?
