The camera, focused on her, seems more uniquely crafted, as if directed by a trained and intentional eye, not just to capture a moment in time, reality show style, or even in a more artful cinema verite style, but it appears to achieve something else, something possibly more novel. The vividness of the light, her animatronic face cast in shadow by the overhead of the balcony, a cut to a wide angle lens giving the audience a brief moment to stare out at glimpses of the Pirates of the City of Brass ride entrance, the queue line for The Tropical Forest Excursion, the spinning One Thousand and One Night's Magical Gem ride, the ropes course and pulleys from the less iconic and increasingly unpopular Austrian Relation Tree House area, and the display for the Charmed Chinese Parrot Room, all of this giving the show an almost auteurish gravitas and production value that seemed missing from most reality shows which more corresponded with the style of the "Previously On" clips from before.

Was this just a mockumentary of some kind, or some sort of experimental TV show, or maybe even a movie?
