To return to Parlance-Jack, that is-that stranger in a familiar land, that Joseph wandering in Egypt, recognizing his brothers without their own recognition, this time without the final reveal, the prodigal returned, only to be turned away. And the Parlances were deep believers, at that, such deep believers that no doubt could be tolerated, the ultimate threat to belief itself, a reformation in reverse, a response, a symptom, an over-reaction.

To reform was not to transform.

After all, even revolutions involved a return to an original state.

What the Parlance family, including Jack, himself being a Parlance, and who would always be a Parlance, seemed (or seems) to misunderstand is that any remake would always contain traces of the original, and as a result, would always be haunted.

There was no avoiding the haunting.

Any attempt was to invite further haunting.

But hauntings themselves, weren't scary, weren't some outside terror here to destroy all things.

They were just somethings which came from other somethings, mishaps, accidents, ironies, magic.

Fantasies within fantasies within fantasies.

The most magical place on earth.

He haunts.

He haunts.

He haunts.
