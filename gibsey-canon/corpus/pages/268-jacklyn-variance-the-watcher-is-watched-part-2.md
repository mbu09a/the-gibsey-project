But even "the new" was also haunted, haunted by the loss of itself, or its inability to sustain itself within the collective imagination. The new has (or always had) even become the new haunting, artists and thinkers across the Gibseyan landscape developing newer and newer ways of haunting themselves, or of being haunted, the creation and dispensation of ghosts, no longer the cliche home-pain of nostalgic familiarity, but the wholesale manufacturing of displacement, disembodiment, dismemberment, dissection, and ex-communication. All the refugees and refuges of the entire subversive underground, even it and they were also haunted, even if ultimately, it was they who were haunting themselves.

Who else could be doing the haunting?

Ghosts aren't some lonely unknown outsider trying to haunt the living.

And to think of them as such was to make the same mistake as the Parlance family.

They were always haunting themselves.

Because there was no outside.

You are always outside.

Always backyard.

When we haunt, and we will always haunt, we can only ever haunt ourselves.

It isn't our responsibility as much as it's our own inevitability, our lack of control.

No one is ever haunted that is in control.

And no one is ever in control.

We are all outside.
