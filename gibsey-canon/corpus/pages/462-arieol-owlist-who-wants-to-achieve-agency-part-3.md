They're engaged in a series of communications, and I know, I know, that's a ridiculously generalized way of putting it, but they were so close then, and it was too early to get any more specific. To even get any more specific would betray a certain kind of secrecy, a secrecy often necessary when mentors are around, let alone mentors who are CEOs of their own created worlds, or was it worlds created for them, before them? The jury's still out on that one. Analysts are still out there on the hunt, adjusting levels, recording the sound and frequencies of various spaces, logging data, with their ears to the ground, and so nothing can be said for sure, either way of course, but Gibstory or time or simply just common damn sense, does suggest that CEOs don't just fall out of the sky.

How could they?

Certain connections are made, maintained, and controlled, like any system, however intimate their connections may be.

Not that Progresso is here to maintain intimacies.

No siree.

What CEO would be?

He's here to maintain, to enforce, that others are intimate with him, not something anyone of any real intimacy would ever really attempt, at least not for extensive periods of time.
