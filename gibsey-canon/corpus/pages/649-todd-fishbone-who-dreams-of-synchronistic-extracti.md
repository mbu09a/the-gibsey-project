He brews himself a cup of coffee and scrolls back through the paragraph looking for any other details with which he can pounce on to trap the chatbot into revealing its true nature before moving on to the kill shot of, "...the safety inside."

There was something about that phrase. He could feel it.

Might as well be "open sesame" or "abracadabra."

Come to think of it, maybe he could try those?

"Automatic sliding doors."

This was a weird choice he could use, maybe?

After all, had DreamRIA selected automatic sliding doors, in some sense, because DreamRIA was an automaton built out of an algorithm or a set of algorithms? And after all, it's not like automatons are anything new? They go as far back as "The City of Brass" from One Thousand and One Nights, right?

Wait?

An awareness seizes him.

That tale felt blazingly pertinent somehow?

Oh, boy, talk about Synchronistic Extraction!

He grabs his copy of the tome from one of his many accumulating bookshelves and searches for the story, flicking through its passages, until, yep, "The City of Brass." It's been a while since he's read it, and so he reviews it, searching for anything pertinent Synchronicities with which he can Extract.
