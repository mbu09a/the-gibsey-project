It's an August afternoon.

They're seated before their black, stained, IKEA kitchen table in Bastrop, Texas, living alone, unmarried, notebook in hand. They're performing the useless action The Author often performs within their notebooks: making plans, scribbling notes, writing to write, and never looking back at any of it ever again.

Fucking useless waste it all is.

They plan what they'll do later in their writing during this process, within their notebook. It is a useless process. They want to develop the skills anyone wants to develop within any craft. They want to develop forms of focused attention, and in particular, their plan today is to create various kinds of landscapes, to move in and out of various landscapes.

"Written landscapes."

They write this title, this phrase, down between the two blue lines that stretch across their notebook paper with a bright, green, number 2 mechanical pencil that's missing an eraser. They have to be cautious of not moving their hand across the page too quickly in case the lead spills out the other end.

"Landscapes are characters and characters are landscapes."

They continue writing.

"Create pockets of focused attention and awareness, like any artist, any painter or photographer, or film-maker showing up at a scene to focus their attention on a given landscape to project an image. This is an exercise."

But they don't finish the exercise.

They stop.

They instead make a plan to finish the exercise later.

But they never finish the exercise.

And they're always doing this, aren't they?

They never finish anything.

They're always forgetting.

They're always planning and never finish anything.

They don't remember.
