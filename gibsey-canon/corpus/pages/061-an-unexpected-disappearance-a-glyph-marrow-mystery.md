"This park is a theme park, a park of themes.

"Name's Arieol, by the way, Arieol Owlist. Either we haven't met before, we have, or you don't remember me. Either way, it's good to meet you, good to meet you again, or to see you again. I'd prepare yourself for an extended dialogue, or a monologue, at the very least, before we begin the First Ascent. Oh, and don't forget to buckle up! We're about to head straight through The Tunnel. Oh, and also I might want to mention this. Be not afraid. Though I know you will be. You won't be able to help yourself, will you? Poor sucker.

"But it's supposed to be a thrill ride, isn't it? Why else do you think there's always somebody that screams?"

The image of Arieol sitting down next to Glyph would later be difficult to recall, though he does remember wanting to yell out a hearty "What the fuck!" at the strangeness of what's happening to him, but this being Gibsey World, he keeps such declarations to himself.

"What the fuck!" He later blurts out, not able to help himself.
