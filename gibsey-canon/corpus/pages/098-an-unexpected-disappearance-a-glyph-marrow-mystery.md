You want the cart to move forward.

You want to be riding the ride.

You want to be alone, forever alone, to wait in line, alone forever.

You may even be dead, you realize, or if you aren't you might as well be.

You have no voice.

You are here, but you don't want to be here.

"But like I said, I'm not trying to subvert anything here. It's just that maybe we've moved so far past losing the need to know what's even real to begin with that we may have even reached something else entirely, maybe an even more novel form of enlightenment, entertainment, or entrainment. It's possible that a new ride's being developed within this endless amusement park of ours, and if so, even if we aren't certain, we might as well ride the ride, shouldn't we? It seems to matter much less now than it once did to define what's 'real' or not, let alone what's hyper-real or not. After all, what isn't reality? Or at least what isn't temporarily mistaken as such? Instead what matters is what we get to create for ourselves. And isn't that just as existential, individual, and personal while also providing a collective project, something which unifies rather than divides?"
