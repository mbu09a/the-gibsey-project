They'd pictured the scene so many times, and it had been so powerful that they'd even wondered if they'd channeled Stillman's ghost by imagining the conversation before it happened. It had been so powerful that this was how they'd come to borderline believe that channeling the souls of loved ones was possible, entirely through fictional means, that they'd already accomplished it, that it was readily available to anyone who was willing to enter the threshold alone and yet, when they'd shown up at the bar, Stillman still hadn't shown up.

They'd inserted themselves into the fucking book for Gibsey's sake.

They should have given the scene to Glyph, probably.

But he's still back at the ride.

At the top of the First Ascent.

Who were they fucking kidding?

Natalie Weissman and The Author in the middle of An Unexpected Disappearance?

What were they fucking thinking?

Did they have no self control?

It was supposed to be a detective novel!
