"I saw ten maidens like Houris of Heaven, and they calling and signing : Come hither to us; and me seemed there was below me a lake of water. So I thought to throw myself down, when behold, I espied my twelve companions lying dead; so I restrained myself and recited somewhat of Allah's Book, whereupon He dispelled from me the damsels' witchlike wiles and malicious guiles and they disappeared. And doubtless this was an enchantment devised by the people of the city, to repel any who should seek to gaze upon or to enter the place. And it hath succeeded in slaying our companions."

The water, the water, the rain, the rain outside the library.

The dark arts.

The safety inside.

The automatic sliding doors.

He has to steady himself.

He paces around in a circle, again.

Breathing.

Calm down.

Calm down.

He takes a heavy breath.

Wipes his brow.

And returns to the book.
