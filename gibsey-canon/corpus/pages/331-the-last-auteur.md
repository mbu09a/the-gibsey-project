And stop for a minute.

I want you to think about what I just said.

Stanley Kubrick on fucking acid.

Have you ever taken acid?

Do you have any idea what it does to one's sense of time?

What it does to one's sense of duration?

Kubrick on acid.

We're talking about one of the most infamous, notoriously demanding and frustrating pain-in-the-asses to work with in all of movie history. Time basically slows to a stand still when you do a scene on his set as many times in a row as he does, and as an actor or crew member on a set like that one, you have to start to wonder if you aren't going to be enveloped in total darkness by the end of it all.

It would probably start to seem like it would never end, like a black hole would appear to swallow up the entire universe.

And maybe when he directs, it does.

And what I'm saying is that Scrillio's even worse than that!

Even worse, I'm telling you!

Do you understand what I'm saying Arieol?!
