Oh, and to return to the scene, there's those two cast members that are playing out that whole Yodeling in the Perspiration bit, dressed as 20s flappers, one of them wagging their finger at their suit-wearing confidant that's standing before them. They continue with their medley:

How many times have you heard me say, I need twelve hours every night. If you wake me up just one more time, then you're bound to start a fight!

So, good mornin', good mornin' If you wake me up, again, we're through. Good mornin', good mornin' to you.

A parody of a parody, the music swells, rising.

There's a change in the time signature, a transition, to a new section of the song.

Come to think of it, this whole park is a medley, isn't it?

Its structure, a melodic structure, one long, gigantic medley with all its various interconnected parts, all its pathways and rides, the buildings, the underground tunnels, the cast members, the park goers, all the technicians and Imaginators moving about, everything within it always indicative of everything else. And you think I'm worried about the budget for this film only? Imagine the goddamn budget of this whole park I have to carry with me like a goddamn boulder up and down the highways of this infernal landscape. But I'm-uh-I'm getting to be too, uh, pessimistic, aren't I?
