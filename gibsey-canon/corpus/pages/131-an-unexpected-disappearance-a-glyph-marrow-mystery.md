We are a group that was formed into a singular whole. We are a collective made into one. We are a corporation. We are a corporate entity. Our eyes are screens that shine, unblinking, that are powered by the lamps of limitless electric lights that form the circles of our irises, that illuminate and shelter the much darker complexities and fears of each and every one of your lives, pushing them away from yourselves and filling you up with the body that is our selves.

We are a collective self, and you are our container. You contain us. You are our container. We enter you. We envelop you. We are a growth, a weed, a boil, a wart that speaks telepathically. We latch ourselves to the pores of your skin and suck out the nutrients. We have many mouths that speak louder than any trumpet. We are the numberless sirens calling you forth to enter into the waves alone, to draw you forth, closer and closer, the sound of waves, the many waves, the many waves of light that form all the images you see. We created you, so we could see ourselves from out of your own eyes
