But as mentioned previously, Agents working for A.D.D. must remain as objective as possible regarding all forms of analysis, and must attempt to do so, at all times. However, it is essential to note that the nature of the text in question has already made this form of objective analysis a problematic and difficult task to accomplish. Despite this difficulty, the values of the M.A.S.S., as well as A.D.D., must and will remain steadfast, strong, and consistent, and the evaluator will be staying consistent to the values and procedures of the M.A.S.S. within this document, as well as within their future analysis reports.

The area of concern which will be discussed in the next series of reports will be the possible identity of the text's unknown author. Within future investigations into the text's content, who and what the author may be, their possible gender, race, sexuality, methods, intentions, exigencies, and biases, each is bound to become an important and separate area for future analysis. Attached is the first document that will be used for analytical purposes, a section titled Jack Parlance Who Misses His Family. The content of this document alone already raises concerns about its unknown author's possible ties to Anti-Corporate and Anti-State ideas and activities, ideas that are clearly becoming more and more popularly circulated throughout the underground complexes of the theme park where both the current evaluator lives, and where, logically based on the location where The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey documents are continually being discovered, the unknown author also likely resides.
