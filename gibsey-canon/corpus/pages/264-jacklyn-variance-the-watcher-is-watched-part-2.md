He was the youngest, so his position as observer rather than participant had existed from the very beginning. To him, all he'd done was share his observations, but to his parents and siblings, his observations implied a confrontation, and they did not agree at all with what he was asking them to confront.

He hadn't understood this.

There was no confrontation that he was aware of?

How could there be?

He was a part of whatever he was observing?

He'd tried to explain this to them again and again.

He was a part of the family, was formed by it, had been brought into existence by it, and all he'd wanted to do was help them to be happy like they'd been before, to help them return to what he'd once seen, to ease the pain and horror of their seeming denial. He hadn't spoken of anything they weren't already aware of, or which they'd denied was real. What they'd denied was a willingness to listen to the observation to begin with.

They'd chosen not to identify.

The beginning of the end was when his siblings came to the decision to longer speak to him individually. It would be discussed as a whole family, or it wouldn't be discussed at all.

This provided no room, no possibility, for intimacy.

This move was, according to his siblings anyway, to preserve the family.

But he knew what it meant.

As a group, the family would continue to preserve itself, and this meant that nothing but public humiliation and shame was left for him to endure.

And thus, he'd become a sacrificial lamb.

Or deer.
