They don't remember the eerie feeling that's produced when a landscape is emptied which is supposed to be filled, or when a landscape is filled which is supposed to be emptied.

And they are this landscape.

They just don't remember.

But they do know they're supposed to be doing something here, within this landscape.

They know this to be true.

They just don't know what it is exactly that they're supposed to be doing here. There's a repetitive sense of lost time passing without the awareness of what time has been lost, or why the time that's been lost has been lost, or why it's even in the process of losing itself, the time, if that is, in fact, what's even happening, which they are unsure of, because they can't remember. It's just gone, or seems to be gone, the time, and whatever it is, or was, they don't, or can't, remember.

They don't remember being within the frame, being on the screens, being on both of the screens.

And they're on screen, within the screens, the many screens, but they don't remember.
