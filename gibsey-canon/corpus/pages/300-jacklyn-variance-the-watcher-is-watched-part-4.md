Jacklyn, as you disappear down the heavily air conditioned hallways of the movie theater and pass the posters framed in globular bulbs, cutting to a split-screen shot, Shot A, on the left, as you hurdle toward the door, Shot B on the right, as you thrust it open into the sunlight-nothing more fresh than those beams of sunlight that slash you in two when you push open the theater exit door, Jacklyn, Jacklyn-I need you to know: your ever wavering competence, your persistence of vision, Jacklyn, I've seen it.

I've seen you.

I'm watching.

I've observed you.

Many, many more times than twice.

So many times.

I've always tried to watch.

I can't help but watch you.

And who could help but watch?

All I have is time.

All we have together is time.
