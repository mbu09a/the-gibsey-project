"Stop and listen. You said this was a slip of the tongue, and you followed this up later but saying something about how you'll just have to prove your innocence. Do you remember that?"

"Well I do remember that, darling, but I'm failing to see how-"

"So you were telling me that you're innocent, but you're also trying to show me and make me feel like you're guilty. Why?"

"How-how did you?"

"Why? Tell me."

"Well, it's really a rather small thing, really, which I'm trying to use to create a larger effect. I was trying to bury myself into your subconscious, darling, digging myself deep, deep underground into the recesses of your conscious and unconscious mind. You see, I'm a Subversionist, and what Subversionists of my ilk are concerned with, more than anything, is the creation of effects. I have very little interest in reality. If I can get you to think that I have something to do with the disappearance, then you'll go deeper into the case, won't you? And with Manny being a dear friend of mine, that's an effect I'm striving to achieve, darling. But how did you know I was even doing this? I really didn't expect you to realize?"

"Your slip was a mistake and your mistake was a slip. I could tell."

"Oh, whatever do you mean?"
