Was their work to be destroyed, to remain unpublished, locked away in some Gibseyan Vault to be known only to themselves, an echo, a tennis ball ricocheting off the garage door and into some alley to sit and rot in a grassy crag, rusted black, by a downpour, all that rain?

Or would their tears not only fall, but Oedipa Maas style, would they hover inside an eternally imagined bubbled container to be carried from eye to eye, cheek to cheek, through the swirling networks of the heart? Would their words, although shrouded in darkness now, later spark to ignite brains through the many tunnels they'd excavated, like highway systems, tunnels which they'd dug with their bare hands, scrapped and bloody fingernails burning and just about ready to rip off-they'd really been fully weeping at this stage, maybe even screamed, so they weren't just smile-cryin', mind you-tunnels they'd wandered through, listening to the sound of their voice reverberate along the walls, the many walls, totally alone, but knowing all who entered these tunnels, these tombs, that if any entered alongside them, they'd also be entering alone, just as they did, which is what made such loneliness so illuminate, so intimate, what transformed it from failed spark into eternal flame, a whole-ass bonfire, an inwardly radiant sacrifice, knowing that they'd entered this tunnel and thrust the kindling upon themselves to light themselves and the horror of their many worlds aflame, and upon picturing this image--this text, I mean--while driving, the song reaches further lines like "she's in a world preserved," "only a few have found the door," and "only silver mirrors running down the corridor," which they just about can't beleive they're hearing because Phillip Bafflement had just reached a door and had just gripped the knob and turned.
