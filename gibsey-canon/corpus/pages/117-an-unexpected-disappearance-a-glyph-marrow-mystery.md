Well that's the odd thing about the ride, isn't it?

There's already something so strange about its existence to begin with, before we even relate it to the novel. The ghost story aspect and what it confronts while existing as a ride in the most original, the most exalted, arguably the most exploitative of all the Gibseyan parks which eventually took over the entirety of civilization and which we've recreated into infinity. Isn't it strange?

Oh, yes, yes. Go ahead. You can go back to what we were talking about with the novel.

So he's the quintessential Gibseyan subject then is what you're saying? Our own isolation, yes, his inability to connect with the other character being an expression of violence. Well, it could be, I suppose. Might be a stretch, but I think I see what you're saying.

Yes, well, I'd only mention that Glyph is a very ineffectual character, and maybe that's quite the contemporary problem isn't it? How difficult it is to affect anything within the world anymore when things are so monopolized.

What is isolation but monopolization?
