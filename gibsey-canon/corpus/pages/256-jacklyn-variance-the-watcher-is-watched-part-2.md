And the buck's phrase is very aptly put.

It would be entirely too easy to accidentally assign blame to the mother, the abandonment.

Why had she let her own little one wander?

But there is no blame.

There is no neglect.

There is no agency.

There is not even a true absence because the attachment, the essential attachment, was only ever theatre, and all Bambino is being forced to do is to confront the reality of their own eternal separation.

For Bambino, the fall of his mother (or her mother, as I, Jacklyn Variance, often thought, this reading being justifiable even objectively because as any audience member should know, women can identify with male characters just as males can identify with female ones), their mother, is a falling from life, the beginning of this fall, the inevitable plummeting of innocence, the plummeting of spring, the death that comes with the new. But the newness, our newness, can't be helped, and neither can Bambino's.
