Huh?

He had been drinking all night.

And the sun was coming up.

He misses Glyph.

Feels guilty, worried.

Is filled with such longing, such need.

But maybe nothing's happened?

Maybe he's just outgrown him?

Didn't need him anymore.

Though he would definitely be compartmentalizing that thought.

He grabs his smart phone from the wooden patio where he set it down before plopping back into the hot tub and calls Glyph. Not likely he'll answer.

He doesn't.

This is Glyph Marrow, leave a message at the beep, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can, thanks.

Beep.

Hey, uh, Glyph! Haven't heard back from you. I'm sure you-burp-I've sure you uh, uh, I'm sure you've seen the news. What was it? Oren Progresso! They're back. They returned. Nothing, uh. Nothing happened. They, uh, they, um. Call me back, OK?
