We are the sun. We want you. We want your bones. We wear you. We will animate you. You have been animated. We have already animated you. We have stretched the faces of our characters like warped mounds of skin across the skin of your own faces. And you will wear us and dance. We dance in the animatronic night as you rest, for we do not sleep. We are restless and hungry. And it is on you that we feed.
