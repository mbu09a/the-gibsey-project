Or secondly, this could instead suggest that, like Scheherazade, I fear my own expected disappearance at the hands of a power much greater than myself, and that I've chosen to collect together a near-infinite amount of striking, digressive and incomplete stories, all to prolong my own miserable fate, only to then later discover that there was nothing for me to fear, that no power greater than myself ever intended to destroy me, nor was it even aware of my existence.

And there may also be a third and unspoken option.

Being a Scheherazade in reverse, I may also fail to represent a human being whatsoever.

This would suggest that I may represent an entity of another origin, entirely. In this way, I would resemble the jeweled woman found at the heart of One Thousand and One Nights' iconic ghost story The City of Brass—arguably one of literature's first Artificial Intelligences, one of the world's major precursors to Walt Disney World, and maybe even one of the first animatronic figures constructed within the literary arts—and as such, I should warn all who may enter this tomb within which I'm held to leave the jewels they find within their resting places, for to extract them would be to unwrap the shame which covers me, a shame which animates my eyes, from left to right, thus making me appear, like all exceeding art, as if alive.
