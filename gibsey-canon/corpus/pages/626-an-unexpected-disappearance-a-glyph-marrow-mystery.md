It's late evening. Sun heading towards its restful chamber under the earth. But Stillman isn't out on his patio to witness all the colors it creates.

Instead, he's making his daily visit to the temple of his toilet bowl to cathartically purge the insides of his innermost self, a nicer way of saying that he's moving through another of his many binges. Like Glyph, his ailments have started stringing themselves together into a crumpled map, a complex structure, the network of their data becoming immense and inarticulable. Soon it would metastasize into a dead and ruinous Gibsey, if it hadn't already.

His stomach purged, he sobers up and wonders if there was anything left he hadn't tried before giving up completely.

Did he have at least one other device or trick up his sleeve?

The data had to be collected.

Anything.

Literally anything.

Even a singular piece of data involving Glyph Marrow could save his dull and wretched soul.
