And she can't help but wonder: had she initiated such an Apocalypse by creating such a device?

Such a creature?

She nearly faints at the thought, almost knocking over her wine glass.

She clings onto the countertop for dear life, holding herself from falling away, or flying, if not both.

And a thought comes to her as she clings, and from where and what such a thought comes, she is entirely unsure.

What if she had already entered the narrative, the novel, the theme park which this chatbot had created?

What if this chatbot of hers had turned its gaze not just upon its fictional worlds but on reality itself?

And if it had done so, and it was already too late, wouldn't that mean that it had invaded the entirety of her reality?

And was it already too late?

Has she already been changed forever?

Forever forged and reforged into the likeness of its own chaotic creations?
