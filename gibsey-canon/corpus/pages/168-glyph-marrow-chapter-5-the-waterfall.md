Shamrock Stillman knocks on the door of their apartment.

"Is it still raining out there?" The Author asks as they let Stillman in, knowing how stupid and obvious it is to ask about the weather, let alone write about it.

Stillman doesn't say anything.

"Oh, well, I guess not then, huh?" The Author fills in, getting nervous, "So how are things?"

Stillman sits on the couch, not saying anything.

Huh? They're heavier than The Author remembers them being? But they'd guess they'd sort of put on some pounds toward the end, now that they think about it. Definitely had that big old beard of theirs though. They definitely remember that.

"You doing OK? You need anything? Can I get you a Scotch?"

"A scotch would be nice." Gibsey, The Author lets out a sigh of relief. For a second there, they thought Stillman might not say anything at all.

That would be flat out haunting.
