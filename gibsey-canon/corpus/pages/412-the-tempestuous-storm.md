You are here. You are here. You are here.

There are multiple worlds, multiple maps-this being Gibsey World, after all-and if a viewer was to look at a map of the park (one of many maps of Gibsey World since Gibsey World is always in the process of being drafted and re-drafted), they'd find a set of four theme parks, as well as a number of resorts and highway systems connecting each park's landscape to one another, but this view, this map, being as expansive as it is, would surely become overwhelming to the average viewer, with so many icons to view and reflect upon at once, and so as a result, many viewers may be forced to shift their center of focus, to force their perspective, and this viewer may then likely decide to instead zoom in further to find The Magical Dominion theme park, the central, most popular park in Gibsey World with all its various rides, attractions, and shops. But this would also, again, upon this new observation, likely become another very overwhelming map to observe with there still being so much to further observe within the Magical Dominion, so this viewer may then also instead need to zoom back out, just a bit, bit more, to find the Magical Dominion Complex, the complex not just of the individual theme park of Magical Dominion itself, but the complex's set of resorts such as Gibsey's Modern Resort, Bell Lake Tower at Gibsey's Modern Resort, Cayenne Creek Villas & Cabins at Gibsey's Great Oak Lodge, Gibsey's Great Oak Lodge, Gibsey's Even Grander Floridian Resort, as well as the complex's various transportation systems linking each of the area's landscapes, the Duorail, the boats moving across Bell Lake, the buses shuttling to and from every resort, the highway, and the parking lots of these areas, all of which are still an overwhelming series of locations and landscapes to all fully take in. So if, again, overwhelmed by the sheer data at hand to collect and recollect, if a viewer was to zoom in, one last time, in order to find a less overwhelming set of codes within this coagulating codex, then they'd zoom in to find a character, Natalie Weissman-the newly cloned Natalie Weissman, or semi-newly-cloned Natalie Weissman-sitting in her office in the Gibstory Building of Gibsey University located nearby the Modern Resort Convention Center in the northwest corner of the theme park map.
