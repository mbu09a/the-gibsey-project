Oren lunges forward, now for the face, and claws his fingernails down Arieol's chest, pushing himself up like a wolf tearing apart a carcass.

"Stop struggling!" Oren snarls.

Arieol dodges away, again, out of Oren's grip, dexterous as ever.

It's never about strength with Arieol. They're all agility, but Progresso has the blind, raging power of a brute, and he's angry. When a predator watches its prey escape, it erupts into the purity of fury that lacks no depth, knows nothing at all, whatsoever, but death itself. and nothing but death.

This is well past seeing the T-Rex in the rear-view-mirror-stage.

The beast is here, and it isn't mother-fucking play time.

It's not even about food anymore.

Mother fucker probably isn't even hungry.

This is well beyond even sport; it's beyond even the preservation of life itself. Death is the true and only driver of this particular exchange. It's clear as the pieces of glass being blown in that early shop near the Entrance Way-the light gleaming off Progresso's eyes-that he'd rather die than have this most precious of prey escape. Better they both die in ruinous struggle than make it out alive knowing he'd failed, or so the eyes tell, blazing with the hatred burning beneath those locked, stubborn sockets.

He roars.

The fucking brute roars.

Can you hear it?
