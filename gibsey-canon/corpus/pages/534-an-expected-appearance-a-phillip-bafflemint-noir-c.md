He shrugs his shoulders and accepts that he'll just have to go in and scan his card at the register inside.

Was this another mistake too?

Or a slip?

It was out of his control.

How was he to know that the machine wouldn't accept his card?

And additionally, how was he to know that, at this very moment, as he walks into the gas station, that one of the strangest and most important slippages of his life was about to occur, a slippage that even he couldn't ignore?

As he walks into the gas station, he opens the door and immediately notices a piece of data, a clue, which he doesn't understand.

The entire front vestibule of the convenience store inside is packed with souvenirs of various shapes, sizes, and formats: t-shirts, stuffed animals, travel mugs, toys, spray bottles, key chains, lanyards, figurines, even sets of what appear to be wearable ears of some kind, which all appear to be like something out of a classic Gibsey World souvenir shop, and since Phillip does live near the Magical Dominion area of his world's civilization, such items were familiar to him.

However, he's never seen a variety of this particular kind before.

And he can't stop staring.
