"Can you just stand up already?" She stands up. "What was the memory?"

She points and the wind chimes, the Moon, and the Sun.

"Was it always like this? Were they always like this?"

"I guess? Maybe it is. Or maybe you did, I mean, have the memory?"

But can she ever really know for sure, can she?

She does, she will.

She will be standing outside The Modern Resort, lighting a guilty cigarette with a trembling hand, very independent now in comparison-the original Natalie had never taken up the habit-she'll wonder,, what was the influence?-will be taking a puff, watching the smoke plume out and will realize that this moment, this future moment, which for her will be a present moment, is a fiction, or a type of fiction, realizes this as she scrolls through to the email the original Natalie Weissman has sent her out of nothing but the blackened purity of her own guilt-the fiction she didn't read-that it functions much in the same way, meaning that the present moment itself is a fiction, or can become one, that it can be seen as such, can be formed into such material, and she sees (or will see) it as such in that exact moment, holding the phone to her eyes as she's smoking, through those dissipating puffs, and she remembers her first memory again, will remember it again, again and again, standing there, and that this is also (or was, or will be) her first memory, both atop cement, both with her fingers trembling and with her breathing, all unspeakable to any other, and all entirely her own.
