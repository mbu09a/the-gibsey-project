It's a Wednesday, and they're starting, at the beginning of their class, on a day, the day, arbitrarily, where they will discuss introductions within essay writing and the purposes they serve.

"Introductions are meant to define and redefine the entirety of everything that's to come," The Author says this to their students.

The entirety?

The entirety?

An entirety is that which can only be accessed in parts, in pieces, that which can be gleamed, inferred, unspoken, or repeated.

The theme song begins.

And all songs are theme songs, songs of themes, theme parks, parks of themes, imaginary landscapes, recordings, records of time, memories skipping from place to place, chords being strung and restrung, back, across themselves, from B back to A, remember?
