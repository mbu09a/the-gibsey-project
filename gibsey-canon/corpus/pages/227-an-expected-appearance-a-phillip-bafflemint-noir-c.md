Though maybe too exciting because as soon as those symbols hit his irises-not that they were what caused such an effect, mind you, nothing caused them per se since the effects were arbitrary--the room started rotating, like a theme park ride.

All he could do was sink down to the damp carpet and wait for the episode to play itself out.

He felt ridiculous, absurd, cliche-it doesn't get more cliche than a detective with vertigo spells, ladies and gentle-germs-but as The Author knows all too well, it was all true, or if not true, it was at least believable.

Surely there's gotta be some detective out there with Meniere's disease.

He waits in line for this twirling disorientation to slow.

And come to think of it, he hadn't even learned a damn thing about London Fox, the disappeared principal he'd come there to search for clues about, well, aside from the fact that she was a verbose slob with papers strewn about her place?
