They don't remember the grass, the metal fence, or the shed in their grandparent's backyard.

They were younger then.

Opposite the fence stood a clothesline, one which they'd never seen used before. Clotheslines were no longer commonly used then, and only a few memories about them are even still left. Theydidn't know the purpose that clotheslines served, and would find out later, though also, as always, they would also forget. As a child, they liked to jump up, grab, and swing from each end of the clothesline's metal poles. They enjoyed the twist of the metal, the soft, chalk-like touch it gave their hands, the way it lingered on their palms after they'd swung off and away from it. They never swung from the line itself, but instead swung from the metal poles that held the clothesline together, on each end, the poles that stretched the white line of the clothesline taut, between two points. They would often kick a ball through the lines and into the other rows, and even though they had no opponent, and they were alone, everyone and everything, when they played this game, was always against them.

This was how they played the game.

A knobby, gnarled oak tree twisted up in the middle of the backyard. Its branches slithered out like petrified snakes marching towards the sky. They thrusted the ball at the knobby center of the oak tree's trunk and back at themselves. Sometimes, when they didn't quite hit the knobby center correctly, the ball would ricochet and bounce to the left or right, depending on where it landed against the oak tree's knobby center. There was no telling where it would go, and there's nothing they could do to predict where it would end up once they thrusted the ball, forever forward.

But they wanted to hit the knob of the tree correctly.

They needed to.

This is important to them.

And they do.

They will.
