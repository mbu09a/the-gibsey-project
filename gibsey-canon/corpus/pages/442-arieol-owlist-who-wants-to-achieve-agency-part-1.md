But fuck adulthood, anyway, whoever really wanted it?

Wasn't that the ultimate Gibseyan theme?

The rejection of adulthood?

It's pretty clear whatever that desire was, or is, is (or was) theater, as well, and boy is that list getting long by now, stretching out like the receipt tape of all time, like a roll of toilet paper that the cat's gotten its teeth into to wander the apartment with that wiley look in its eye.

And it was at this moment of observational possibility (if that is indeed what it was) that Arieol notices a small piece of flesh growing atop Jack Parlance's flesh, a growth.

Or that's how Arieol would describe it, or is describing it.

And where in Gibsey did that image come from?

Did it just accumulate?

Arieol didn't think much of it at first.

Arieol just continued their observations, trying to ignore it.

Wouldn't you?

No, Arieol wouldn't continue, actually, and they don't.

They stop.

Or they at least stop to make a note.

Some sort of genre trip to come, body horror, maybe?

Just a guess at the possible coming attractions, an attempt at precognition.
