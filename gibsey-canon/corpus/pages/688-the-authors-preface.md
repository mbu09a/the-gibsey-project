Something's off.

Something or someone's messed with the images.

Something has been removed.

They know this.

They remember.

An author, The Author, stands against a railing watching screens, staring at projected images, hypnotized, as if in trance. They appear to be in a movie theater, but it isn't a movie theater, at least not exactly. It's more of a place for them to stand and watch, for them to stand and observe the landscape. They're staring at two separate screens before them, both at once, one on the right, and one on the left, differentiated, like a set of bifurcated divisions, like polarized light, like a set of choices made in order to establish the structure of a game, or a tutorial, or like a pair of eyes, blinking, like two rectangles, themselves four sets of right angles, split, repeated, separated into the two perforated screens of a viewfinder, a set of images.

Outside, between the two rectangled images, between the two screens, are a set of plastic, red-oak, Greek-style pillars. A dark-red curtain, gold lining its bottom edge, sits behind the pillars, and underneath this curtain, on either sides of the two screens, are sets of shopping and display items, likely from the winter season of the park: sweatshirts with Dickey Dog head prints, generic long-sleeve t-shirts with the Gibsey World logo, navy travel mugs, white t-shirts with images of the American flag, baseball caps, sets of table glasses with images of Dickey and Daisey Dog printed on them.
