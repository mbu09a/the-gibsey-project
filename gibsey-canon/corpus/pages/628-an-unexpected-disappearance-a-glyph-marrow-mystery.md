So already, by the time he's midway through the line, passing the spigot shooting water into that rusty, tortured container, he's already given up. If he can't picture Glyph's face, then there's nothing left for him to find.

And there was even an almost peace to it.

Maybe not a flat out acceptance, but at least it would be over.

He could close the investigation.

But he knows that the door has closed itself, and he's terrified that once closed, he'll never be able to open it again.

And suddenly the line didn't look so long.

It was Glyph Marrow's favorite ride.

Even if he couldn't remember Glyph's face, couldn't conjure that mask before his eyes, Glyph was contained within the space of this place.

It was the x axis, and Glyph was the y.

Subject and object.

Word and image.
