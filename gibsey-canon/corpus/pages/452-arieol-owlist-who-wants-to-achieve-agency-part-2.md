And if agency is a practice, then The Author can practice it.

They can practice making choices, even if they're not sure the choices are real.

They can practice taking action, even if they're not sure the actions matter.

They can practice asserting themselves, even if they're not sure they exist.

They can practice being an author, even if they're not sure they're The Author.

And maybe, through practice, the distinction between real agency and performed agency will become irrelevant.

Maybe, through practice, the experience of agency will become indistinguishable from agency itself.

Maybe, through practice, The Author will become what they're pretending to be.

This is what The Author hopes.

This is what The Author chooses to believe.

Not because they're certain it's true, but because believing it feels better than not believing it.

Not because they have proof, but because hope feels better than despair.

Not because they know it will work, but because trying feels better than giving up.

And so The Author will try.

They will try to practice agency.

They will try to create the experience of choice.

They will try to live as if their actions matter.

They will try to write as if their words have power.

They will try to exist as if their existence is real.
