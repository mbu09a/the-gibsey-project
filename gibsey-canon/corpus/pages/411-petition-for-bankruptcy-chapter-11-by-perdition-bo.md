Commitment to a New Chapter

In conclusion, The Debtor affirms its resolve to turn this challenging chapter into an opportunity for growth and reinvention. After all, who doesn't want to read a document that files for bankruptcy for pages upon pages within an already looping, repetitive, and self-referential narrative structure? If any author strove to make that type of writing consistently inventive, well, we may just be able to make a hit, after all. We are committed to learning from our past, building a stronger foundation, and charting a course towards a future that upholds the highest standards of literary excellence and ethical practice. Also, like the structure of the worlds we created for ourselves that we could change at any fucking minute but we never fucking do, as long as it's in our singular benefit rather than for the mutual benefit of the whole, like the unwavering eye of Gibsey itself, we can be counted on to show the fuck up.
