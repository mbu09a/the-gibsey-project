What the hell is even happening!

I'm living at the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride.

I have a simple life.

No name, no job.

Very few memories, and the few things that I do know and think can't even be trusted.

I'm just a normal, regular human being.

But I can admit, it's all very strange what's happening to me.

It's difficult to explain.
