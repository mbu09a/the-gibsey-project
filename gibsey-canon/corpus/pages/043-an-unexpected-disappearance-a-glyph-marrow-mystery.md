This has become my life, now.

I'm waiting in a queue line.

And I don't even remember how I got here.

For all I know, I've been walking through this queue line my entire life.

Maybe this is what it means to have a life?

And maybe this is what everyone's life is like?

Waiting in a queue line forever.

Waiting for a ride that never comes.

Waiting for a ride that I'm too afraid to ride.

I continue my walk and come across a large boulder.

It is also the word, boulder.

It is simultaneously both of these things.

The boulder and the word boulder.

The rock and the word rock.
