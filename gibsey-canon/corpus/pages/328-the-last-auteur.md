The actors playing the cast members shake hands with the extras playing the park goers, and I mean, with the set the way it is, they might as well be actual park goers themselves.

'Hi there, we're glad you're here!' 'Great to see you.'

"It's all very convincing, very life-like, very Gibsey-esque, very animated. Couldn't have simulated reality any better. And imagine my frustration seeing this happen within the context of this budget, seeing this pompous asshole unsatisfied with all this that's being done all on his behalf while our investment is playing out right in front of all us, and I truly don't know, can't even begin to understand what Scrillio doesn't like about it. I think there's something wrong with him. Knowing him, it probably has something to do with the "realism" he doesn't like. Gibseydamn it, the multiple imbecilic discussions we've had about that Gibseydamn concept.

But the actors, the voices, the performances of the cast members, like all experiences in Gibsey World, they're all heightened.

They're beyond the norm.

A regular voice? Or a casual welcome to an audience? That, for a recreation of Gibsey World? Nope, that's simply not enough.

This is a world of magic that must be created and recreated in real time, that must be manifested again and again, continually.
