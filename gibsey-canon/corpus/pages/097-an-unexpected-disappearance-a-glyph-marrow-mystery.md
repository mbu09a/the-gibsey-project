You're back at the First Ascent.

You're back in the minecart with Arieol.

The words pour over you like water.

Liquid fumigation.

You're in the mine cart sitting before this chattering chatterer.

You can't seem to speak, not that you don't have the ability, but you can't seem to bring yourself to.

It's a horrible dream.

It isn't a dream.

It's a nightmare.

Arieol stops for a moment and frantically glances around to and fro to check if any individuals, or a specific individual, is hiding in the nearby scenery.

"Hey Glyph, let me know if you see a woman that's looking for me, or at me, alright? Her name is Jacklyn Variance. You see her anywhere, then you let me know, alright? Anywhere at all. Even after the ride's over. I think she thinks she's onto me, at least that's what I think is happening. I can never really know for sure."
