And so The Author practices.

They practice agency by writing this letter.

They practice choice by deciding to investigate.

They practice hope by believing that answers might be found.

They practice existence by continuing to exist.

They practice authorship by continuing to write.

Not because they're certain it will work.

Not because they're certain it matters.

Not because they're certain they're real.

But because practicing feels better than not practicing.

Because trying feels better than not trying.

Because living feels better than not living.

And maybe that's what Progresso would tell them, if Progresso were to read this letter, if Progresso were to respond, if Progresso were to care.

Maybe Progresso would say: "Stop thinking so much. Start doing more."

Maybe Progresso would say: "Stop questioning. Start acting."

Maybe Progresso would say: "Stop worrying about whether you have agency. Start practicing agency."

Maybe Progresso would say: "Stop wondering whether you're real. Start living as if you're real."

Maybe Progresso would say: "Stop doubting. Start choosing."

And maybe Progresso would be right.

Maybe the secret to agency is to stop trying to understand it and start trying to practice it.

Maybe the secret to existence is to stop trying to prove it and start trying to live it.

Maybe the secret to meaning is to stop trying to find it and start trying to create it.
