The Author stands elevated above the wood-flooring of the Main Square Cinema USA building on top of a platform intended as a space for park goers to stand and observe the two screens before them, as well as the merchandising in front of these two screens. The platform is made up of 3/5ths of a circle, the other two 1/5ths being the 3 steps leading down to the wood-flooring, each to the left and right of the platform, which are perpendicular to the screens, each step having, also on the left and right of their surface, a set of dim, rectangular, plastic LED stage lights. Still facing the screens, The Author realizes they need to make a decision about which set of steps they should walk down: left or right? They make this choice arbitrarily, without thought, and in doing so, they make a choice which is outside of their control.

They decide to step down the set on their right.

After stepping down from the platform, they stand, waiting, and they continue to stand, waiting, watching the screens, waiting for another title to appear, or another set of titles, but nothing appears.

Nothing does.

The screens remain blank, black, and empty.

Nothing appears.

Nothing?

There's nobody here.

And this thought is as immediate as the awareness that comes with it.

There's nobody here.

There's nobody here.

They're entirely and immobilizingly alone.
