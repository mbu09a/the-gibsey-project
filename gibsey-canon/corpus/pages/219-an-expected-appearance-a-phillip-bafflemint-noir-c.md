Handwritten scratches of thoughts were etched across lined notebook paper organized around the space without a basic definition of rhyme, reason, or order. Printer pages scratched on by blue-felt tip pens appeared to be thrust into the air at random to simply fall where they may. Organized folders and notebooks of various colors with written notes and sketches held within them were stuffed into as many crevices as could be located within the excessively crowded space-couch cushions, the cracks between dresser drawers, tangled within piles of clothes. He even noticed that a few Moleskins were stuffed between the blinds of the living room's windows, as if these particular notebooks had been boomeranged out of a cannon of sorts-clearly of an explosive and not literary variety-and if anything, he honestly couldn't picture any other way they'd ended up in such odd positions? In fact, much of it all seemed as if some good samaritan had stuffed so much of the house's scattered pages and papers into firework casings so they could light a fuse, stick their fingers in their ears, and waddle off into some unknown land to-kaboom!-blast off! There were manuscript pages of printed text and articles all over the place held together by strained binder clips and staples which were struggling to hold their pages together and carry themselves across the rainbow bridge like a jockey trying to carry a sumo wrestler across a tightrope stretched taught between the Empire State Building and the fucking moon, as well as sketchbooks, maps, drawings, kabbalistic-looking outlines of various spheres connected by an array of etched lines and crosses, sticky notes, movie and plays scripts with detailed but hard to make out notes calligraphed upon their surfaces in some sort of red pen or ink, graph paper with various designs, notes, and a series of what appeared to be gestaltic repetitive designs swirled upon them, which when looked at closely revealed a negative space that one can't quite easily define because, after squinting for a just a little bit longer, the negative space which had been formed by the repetition of alternative shapes, would shift, to be replaced by the alternative shapes which had formed them, becoming the alternative themselves, and back and forth and back and forth, ad nauseam. Pencils and pens of various shapes, sizes, modes, colors, mechanical and/or plain-old-original styles were also scattered about and even stabbed into the walls in places which themselves seemed written upon in some sort of graphic or symbolic scrawl.

He felt like he was going to have an aneurysm.
