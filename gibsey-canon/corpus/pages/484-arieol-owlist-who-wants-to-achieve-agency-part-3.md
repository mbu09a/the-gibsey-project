The VI of Pentacles.

This is a card of-

Oh.

Oh no.

Oh, dear Gibsey, no.

(You're just going to have to accept this is what you turned over. There's no changing it now).

This is a card of giving and receiving.

No, it can't be.

No.

There's nothing weird about that at all!

Don't want to ignore that one and let the viewers, or readers, or data-analysts, fill in the gaps on that one!

And do remember folks, my dear and astute audience members, that some gaps aren't worth filling in.

Good, Gibsey!

It's uh, wow, uh, it just-it's really tough to be here folks.

It really is.

But let's just try to stay focused on the card, though, shall we?

The VI of Pentacles.

It's a card of giving and receiving.

A man with a stretched out hand, dispenses two coins to two beggars, and oh, wouldn't ya know, Arieol is on his knees nearly collapsing, eyes now dry from the pain of seeing all this occur, going through it.

Sometimes you just don't have a good time, and you just have a really, really bad day.

That's just how it is.
