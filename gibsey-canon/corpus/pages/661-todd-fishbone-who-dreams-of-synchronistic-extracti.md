And so they approach the city and it's massive. It's beautifully described.

So beautiful Todd reads that passage a number of times.

"It was a city with gates impregnable; but void and still, without a voice or a cheering inhabitant. The owl hooted in its quarters; the bird skimmed circling over its squares and the raven croaked in its great thoroughfares weeping and bewailing the dwellers who erst made it their dwelling."

Wow. They really made it huh?

Ok, ok, so they don't seem to easily find a way inside-inside, huh?-and so Abdil has them wait three days, and he circles the whole city only to realize you can't get inside, that there's no gate, or that it if there is one, that can only be opened from the inside-

Wow, again, "the safety inside," right? What the fuck?

Was DreamRIA's own narrative a reference to this? A library? A digital library? What is a library but a ghost town? What the hell is happening?

Oh, and oh, yeah, they also come upon these seven tablets which thematically match the content of the tablets from before-not directly, but their themes are the same-Ok, Ok, that makes sense, the twinning, the doubling, about the inevitably of death and how we shouldn't cling to things, the ephemeral nature of life. Ok, Ok, got it, it's pretty repetitive-and of course Emir gets all weepy and inspired each time, getting more and more stoked to go into the City of Brass and feeling like his work is extra important.

What the ever living shit? How does it keep breaking down like this?
