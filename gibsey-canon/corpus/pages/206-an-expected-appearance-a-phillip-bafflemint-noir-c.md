Phillip could always accept things as they were. Everything, either high or low, good or bad, always found its way to the middle. His sexual interests, for example, weren't so mild that he was totally asexual, but like most drives in his life, it simply seemed as if he could only crank the amplifier to a 3, at most. He just couldn't be bothered to move the knobs any higher. Unlike The Author of The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, Phillip wasn't prone to extremes or excesses. His focus was on comfort and reliability, not novelty and spontaneity. The low-settings of his life were enough for him to socially get by and only mildly seem like a loner, and they'd never be enough to create much of an effect on his world, not really. Not that Phillip wanted to have such an effect. He was comfortable with where he was already. No need to change it. He maybe wasn't entirely comfortable with himself. He'd always been a bit heavier than he wanted to be, for example, but it wasn't something he thought about much, and when he did, he could always go running each morning, or to his apartment's gym and exercise such thoughts away. He did this enough to keep the thoughts mostly remote, and continued on, again, with his life, all of it set to level 3.

Again, similar to Glyph Marrow, Phillip Bafflemint was a detective, but unlike Glyph, his own detective work was much more conventional and less of a metaphysical or inter-dimensional variety.

For now, anyway.
