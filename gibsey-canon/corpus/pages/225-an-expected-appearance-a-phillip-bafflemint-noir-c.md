It may be helpful to note the sensitive importance that the one's inner ear holds over one's sense of organized balance, an essential detail since it provides expositional context which should hopefully fill in some of the struggles Philip has had since childhood and which likely represent the root cause that originally produced his constant need to turn the knobs of his existence down to such a banal degree. It also explains the reasons for much of what is about to befall old Phillip, truth be told. Whether it be the iconically spiraled cochlea, or some other passageway within the inner ear's gnarled labyrinths, the slightest shift, fluid build up, or change to the inner ear's most sensitive of initial conditions can often prove to be disastrous.

And Phillip knows this better than anybody because, ever since he was a child, he's had a an ailment called Ménière's disease, a dysfunction within the inner ear that can cause debilitating dizzy spells, vertigo, nausea, hearing loss, and other disorienting complications due to the sensitive landscape nestled behind one's ear drum getting all a-fucked around with (or getting such fuckery genetically passed down). The exact causes of such a condition, like The Author's identity, are still unknown. Not that the causes really matter, for Phillip anyway, because the effects have certainly been enough for him to have to deal with, to say the least.
