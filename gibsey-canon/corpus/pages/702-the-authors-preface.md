Oh, great Gibsey, there's so much to do and think about at any given time, so many things to connect to one another. Too many, much, much too much to think about, too many names to name or identify, too many landscapes to observe, but the point taken, the given point, their given point, where it all begins, where it all began, is like a dot on a map-you are here-it's all further backwards, backward, backyard, and the backyard unravels, corkscrew-like, down the ladder of all time.

They don't remember what it is that they're looking for.

And what they're looking for, which they will never find, isn't only a landscape, but the landscape, the landscape of all landscapes, one which connects, or will connect, to all other landscapes, a central point, a major map of all space and time, the world in a grain of salt, eternity in 59 minutes and 32 seconds, arbitrary connections, spiraling, all the way down.

But they will never find it.

Because they don't remember.

And this landscape, the landscape in question, it's like a tag in a screenplay. It's like two tags combined within a screenplay. It's both an interior and an exterior, like a camera that's panning out, wide lensed, to capture it all at once, from every conceivable angle.

It likely has to do with attention, or lack thereof, disordering deficits doing what they do best.

They're forgetting.
