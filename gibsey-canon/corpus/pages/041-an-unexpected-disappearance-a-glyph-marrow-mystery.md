He didn't understand.

He didn't understand because I hadn't been able to explain it to him.

But the thing is, and I know this for certain, he didn't even try to understand it.

He didn't even attempt to try.

He couldn't even fathom that something like what was happening to me could be happening to someone.

And maybe it couldn't be?

Maybe I'm delusional?

Maybe I've lost my mind completely?

And maybe everything I think is happening to me isn't actually happening to me?

Maybe there's nothing wrong with me, maybe the doctor is right, and maybe everything that's happening to me is just a matter of me having some sort of breakdown?

Maybe I should be taking antipsychotics?

Maybe I should be admitted to a mental hospital?

Maybe I've already been admitted to one?

Maybe I'm already there, and maybe I've been there for years?

The objects continue to lurk around me, waiting to be seen, along with their words.
