But to project one last final moment of clarity before placing The Author within this particular setting, to differentiate a final problem or conflict which could and/or should be developed and/or addressed, both within this unfolding narrative and by you, my dear and astute reader-especially since a common element of amateurish writing is to provide extraneous examples, to mention conflicts instead of letting them play themselves out within the unfolding of an introductory narrative, what is referred to by less amateurish writers as "telling" rather than "showing"--this conflict, conflict being the basis of any writing, really, or even of any creation myth for that matter, this conflict is (and/or was) an inner conflict for The Author, one which they were unsure they could control or change within themselves, one which was outside of their control, and this specific conflict, the even greater conflict than all of the other mentioned conflicts, if not the conflict which contains all the other conflicts, making it arguably the conflict to end all conflicts, was the continued and sustained loss of their own memories. What this meant was that, no matter how hard they tried, no matter what they did, said, attempted, or wrote, The Author would often realize that over and over again, they were fated to consistently lose many, if not most, and inevitably even quite possibly all of their memories. Now, to be clear, this loss of memory itself, it being guaranteed and fated to continually occur, the inner conflict for The Author wasn't, in fact, whether or not they could or couldn't remember something at any given time since this occurrence was fated to occur and re-occur, continually, but instead, the conflict was whether or not this loss of memory-and it's inevitability-was a positive or a negative occurance, or to put it another way, whether this loss of memory itself was a blessing or a curse, or to put it yet another way, it wasn't the loss of their memories that conflicted The Author, but instead, it was how they should perceive such a loss, knowing that the loss itself would always be inevitable, and oftentimes, they would notice, while in contemplation of this conflict, or while reflecting about it, upon reflection, they'd notice that they'd often find themselves losing their train of thought, causing them to forget what it was they were thinking about to begin with, even who they once were or even still are, oftentimes entirely, which would then lead them to feel even more conflicted than they'd initially felt to begin with, without knowing or remembering what or why it was they'd felt conflicted about in the first place, leaving them without a starting point or landscape with which to place themselves within, whatsoever.
