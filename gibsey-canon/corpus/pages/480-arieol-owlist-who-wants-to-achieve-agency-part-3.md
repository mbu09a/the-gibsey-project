"Please.

"Oh, please.

Oh, please Arieol.

"You must.

"You must!

"Do it.

"Do it!

"I need you to make my outside in.

"Arieol, please.

"You must.

"I need you!

"It's what you were born to do.

"It's what you were made for.

The whole cliche of bile rising to Arieol's throat type image isn't necessary to provide here, especially since as reader, you're likely already experiencing the sensation yourself.

Such an image sure does create a sort of reality effect, does it not?

So do forgive the details.

Content is more Gibsey's job to take care of, after all.

Arieol keeps asking themselves in that wandering, itinerant, spinning ride of a skull of theirs-Foolbear the Flying Giraffe style-why me? Why did this have to happen to me? And how is Parlance just sitting there typing away as this thing is swinging back and forth like that one jack-in-the-box in that classic Midnight Area episode with that tyrannical, telepathic little kid with the special powers?

Were they the only one perceiving all this?

And if so, what had caused them to perceive it?
