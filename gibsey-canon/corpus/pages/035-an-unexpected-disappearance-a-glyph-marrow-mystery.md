I guess a pool doesn't have to mean a swimming pool exactly? A basin?

A reservoir?

Definitely not a reservoir, that sounds much more like something meant to contain water purposefully, a body of water that's used as storage, and this was very different. It was more just used as an embellishment to a queue line, as a fixture of exceedingly light entertainment, so maybe a pool would be correct, after all? At least more correct? Or maybe a basin?

The first sensation that comes to me when I first notice my ailment is when I pass a spigot of water falling into a pool.

No, that still doesn't feel right.

Maybe there isn't a word for the object which I'm trying to describe.

Surely you're thinking that I'm already speaking of my ailment at this point, but the funny thing is, I'm not. I haven't gotten to it yet, or at least not fully. Or if I am, or have been, it's now become a wholly different ailment from the one before, and like I said, it's really best to keep it to one ailment at a time, otherwise it makes things so much harder, so let me go back one last time and try to explain myself.

Like I said, it isn't going to be easy.
