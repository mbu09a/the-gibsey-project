The boil, the juicy, gelatinous flesh-on-flesh, part-open-wound, part cauterized abreaction had crystallized itself further, fossilizing into a bulbous, twitching mass behind Parlance's knuckle.

It bounced as Jack typed.

Arieol covers their mouth in shock, their eyes wide, teeth chattering-that sort of thing-not quite cartoonish, but near-cartoonish, like something out of that Gibseyan classic Who Censored Roger Mexico, somewhere between animation and reality, suspended animation, or suspended reality, take your pick.

The growth, the wart, the boil, whatever it was, they noticed, in horror, that it had formed a face.

It was grimacing.

They were sure of it.

You had to squint your eyes to even notice it was there.

It almost blended into the surface of itself if you weren't looking carefully enough, meaning the face, of course, not the wart itself, though it didn't seem that Parlance was aware that this growth had appeared on him at all with it bouncing around like that, with him typing away like mad, and it just sitting there, growing. Obviously it didn't have the same height or opacity, but it reminded Arieol of those inflated displays you see at Used Car Dealerships, what even were they called?

Inflatable-men?

Why the fuck were they called that?

And what the ever living fuck was Arieol getting themselves into?

This was what.

It opens its mouth.

It starts to speak.

"Oh, he-he-he-hello there Arieol. I can't believe it. Someone's finally here to hear the wonderful story which I have come here to tell."

It licks its lips.

It licks its fucking lips.
