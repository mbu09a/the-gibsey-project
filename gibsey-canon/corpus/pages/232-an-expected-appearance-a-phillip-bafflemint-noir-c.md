The ear bobs up and down against the light.

"Did you listen?" The ear asks Phillip, their question hovering, like they are, rhetorically, in the air.

Phillip shakes.

"What happened to the realism?" He ponders, staring down at the ground where the spotlight falls.

"Realism? You were promised a hypnagogic state. What else did you expect?"

"Aren't you supposed to help me?"

"Yes, didn't you listen?"

"I've tried to."

The ear continues to hover.

"What are you? Some sort of excessively machine-ic device?" Phillip inquires, confused.

"Ah, so you have been listening. Although a quality assessment, you may want to remember that the theme park within which you live uses devices such as forced perspective, processes which makes objects appear larger than they are in reality. And so the process which you've stumbled into is one that's much stranger than a deity that can be found within a machine. You created both the machine and the deity, and therefore, although you were hoping for escape, you will likely be forced to hear the vibrations of your vocal chords chatterering on forever. Sound vibrates, and all is vibration. And that's the end of it all of it, forced perspective or not."
