He somehow knew how to stop the cart, how to freeze it in time and space, this time.

Somehow.

How did he know?

How had he acquired such a devilish device?

Maybe he'd been watching how Arieol had done it, had observed the language of their body?

Or maybe the cart was accommodating, halting at the different pitches and heights of the ride, the story.

Or had he been turned into a pillar of salt?

Was he doomed to wait here forever, to wander?

Was it all dream?

And if so, had Arieol been the one dreaming?

The words, the words, the damned words.

Had he just rejected all that was conjuring him into existence?

Even if this possibility was so, and they'd now be gone forever to leave him stuck here forever, he knew he wouldn't be holding onto that possibility for very long.

He felt the frustration dissipate, disappear along with Arieol, and almost immediately, but it wasn't just because he could now ride the ride without interruption.

He felt something else.

Something new.

Or was it new?
