If an audience holds Bambino responsible then they have misidentified the character. Their emotional connection to the film has been entirely severed and by choice, the terror of such a scripture, all the animating terror of its liveliness, is killed and made dead. And this would be caused by a conscious choice, conscious choices being nothing if not a sign or symbol of agency, that which Bambino lacks.

And this is Parlance's horror, not the scene itself-he hasn't even seen the film before, bumbling consumer that he is, which the rest of us will be fated to experience and re-experience-but his horror can be posed as a question, this time, formed from much, much more than a singular noun.

Who would choose to abandon their own mother?

Jack Parlance would and did.

He has and still is, at least according to his family.

This made him some kind of monster, didn't it?

Or into one?

He'd done it all, and he'd done it to himself.

No Gibseyan film has ever existed that isn't about family.

To wander from such a subject was to wander to one's own death.

Family was Gibsey.

And Gibsey was family.

It was like an agency in this way, a theatrical role.

He'd soiled the sacredness of his work-life balance.
