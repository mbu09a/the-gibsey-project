Inundated with the need to escape from this apartment, her greatest comfort now is sleep.

With all the time in the world, there would always be more time to sleep.

And there is a dream that comes to her often when she sleeps, a dream of Natalie's that she's dreamt again and again in recent nights.

In this dream, she lives thousands of lifetimes, the same lifetime, over and over again, slipping further and further down the chain of her own being, plummeting, in free-fall, without a ground in sight. She realizes that she's falling within the dream because she realizes, while falling, that there's no ground for her to see below her, and there never will be one, no ground, no line, no landscape to fall into. She is an object in motion, and she will remain in motion. She's noticed this, within the dream, that even when it does seem that she is to come to a stand-still, she is instead transformed, repeated, would often and will always repeat, back into motion, and she continues this motion, continues repeating herself; she is form animated.
