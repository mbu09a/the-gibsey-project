If faced from the right, the geysers transform into six waterfalls, again, corresponding with the six major colors, though he'd never noticed before how the colors shifted with each viewing rather than matching directly across all three sets of images. Interesting. Though he did notice the colors did stay regulated to their corresponding primary or secondary set, red shifting to yellow then to blue, and purple shifting to orange then to green as he moved from left to right, and so on, depending on which color he'd start out with. Or he could walk through the painting backwards, start with the waterfall and see them shift in an opposite order. How had they gotten the images to do that while still looking like a singular image, the geysers of the center, all the while?
