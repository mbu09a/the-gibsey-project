It may be important to mention that the many things that are continually slipping my mind aren't a part of my ailment. Not that they aren't an ailment. Anything can become an ailment, after all. Anything at all. And because of this, even a singular ailment is more than enough to focus on at any given time. It certainly wouldn't be worth one's time to pile on more ailments when one has already started to focus on one.

It's strange, the random details that magnetize themselves to our memories, like lint clinging to a sweater, like sparks flickering from flames, like the soapy residue that forms different shapes in the bathtub which stare at you, popping and winking as you try to lay back to relax, at the end of a long day.

I'm not exactly sure how I know these things.

Because I've never even bathed.

At least not that I remember.
