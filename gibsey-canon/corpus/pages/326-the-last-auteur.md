An announcement is made. Like I said, it was all totally authentic and just like the original, the music swelling, the cast members high-fiving each other as the voice comes in to say:

Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, Welcome to the Magical Dominion!

And you know me. I'm not easily impressed, Ariel. I know this will surprise you, but most of the time, I'm faking my enthusiasm. In fact, that's probably the most common part of my job.

Internally, I'm hardly ever impressed.

But the positive energy of those performances, I mean, it becomes undeniable for me in that moment, Arieol. Something special is going on there, and I can't deny it. I don't have to fake anything, and it all starts becoming our collective energy, all of us within that landscape, all of us on set. It's really starting to affect us all by that point. At least all of us but Scrillio, of course.The cast members, they're all really doing well, but this director, he just can't see it, or he can't ever seem to believe it while it's happening right in front of him, right in front of his very eyes. And I mean, I'm breathing it all in as best I can, even with those budget cuts in mind. You see, Arieol, I'm a fucking adult. I'm not some man-child director trying to affix this bull shit scene to my fucking career. I can see that there's something infectious about this place, about Gibsey World, and his reconstruction of it.
