The question is this: How do you know you're real?

How do you know your thoughts are your own?

How do you know your actions matter?

How do you know you're not just a character in someone else's story?

And if you are just a character, how do you live with that knowledge?

How do you find meaning in a fictional existence?

How do you assert agency when you suspect you might not have any?

These are the questions The Author would like answered.

These are the problems The Author would like solved.

But The Author suspects that Progresso doesn't have answers to these questions.

The Author suspects that Progresso has never even considered these questions.

The Author suspects that Progresso lives in a world where such questions are irrelevant, where doubt is a luxury, where certainty is the default state.

And maybe that's the real difference between them: not talent or ambition or opportunity, but the capacity for doubt.

Progresso doesn't doubt.

The Author can't stop doubting.

Progresso moves forward.

The Author moves in circles.

Progresso creates.

The Author transcribes.

Progresso is.

The Author wonders whether they are.
