After the first ascent, the train drops into a series of caves.

Artificial grottos mimicking the living, the material, the stones, the animatronic bats, the flapping of wings.

The Angel of Death.

To Wander Through the Victorian Era.

He notices, Glyph notices, he observes, a life after life, between life, empty in the lobby of the Even Grander Floridian, in the empty lobby of the Even Grander Floridian Resort, life's deepening sediment, a tomb, but a much more terrifying tomb, one of infinite release rather than forced containment-what is a tomb, (or death) after all, but a space of forced containment?-one of babeling complexity, cursed to forever mistake objects as subjects and subjects as objects in the empty lobby of the Even Grander Floridian Resort.

Glyph must've pushed himself up from off the pillar(s) at some point cause he's no longer in that emptied and emptying lobby, which like any endless stream of water eroding away the sediment of his life's landscape, has released so many words themselves like so many speckled flakes of dirt and dust collected like data from the sides of this fluvial container which contains himself, itself, rivers snaking through the mountains, rivers of blood, streams of domed archways, hallways, trying to focus his clogging attention, snaking through the Even Grander Floridian, babeling through the Victorian Era, the bottles in ships encased in glass skies like animatronic bats.
