When I used to stare out at the world around me, I would see things, and only things: a rake, a water bottle, an electric socket, a trash bag. And of course there'd be other things, as well, other objects of a different, maybe more abstract variety: wind, movement, light, items which have more substance than mere objects, or which used to have substance, but which aren't exactly objects in a concrete sense, more experiences, feelings, sensations. But the thing was, and now still is, all things have become words for me, whether abstract or concrete, instantaneously, and all in one moment.

Water.

Water is water.

And water is water and water and water and water and water.

I later idiotically tried explaining this idea to my doctor.

He was a hearty man, this doctor of mine, whom I'd asked about it.

Clean shaven, fat, round face with a scruff of brown hair and a name tag.

He often smiled when he came in to speak with me. Or I can't say often, because I only visited him once, but I suppose I think about the encounter often.

They aren't always energetic, doctors.

They're often tired looking, overworked, which makes an energetic doctor easier to trust somehow.

He certainly had energy.
