"Overwhelmed, huh? Well, I don't blame you. It's always scary at the start of a new ride. And your life is a very strange one, Glyph Marrow. The Author didn't use the word 'Unexpected' in the title of this novel-within-a-novel for no reason!"

Glyph does remember Arieol grinning repeatedly during their initial exchange. Whoever or whatever Arieol was or is, they were certainly trying to have fun with it, but Glyph wasn't sure whether this was at his own expense or not? He immediately feels like he's being toyed with, and likely, for good reason.

Maybe he is or was?

"Don't forget though," Arieol voice lowers to a whisper, trying to shift into a more serious register, at least as serious as Arieol can be within a setting associated with such repeated amusement, "You're supposed to be doing detective work, remember? You're investigating me, by the way, or have you, like The Author, also forgotten?"

Glyph mouths these words to himself, this time, not saying them out loud, but instead miming them in capital letters: What The Fuck?
