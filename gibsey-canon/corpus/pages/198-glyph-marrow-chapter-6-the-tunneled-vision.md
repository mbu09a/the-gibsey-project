"Did you do that?" Arieol asks them, "It wasn't me?"

"I'm not sure? I do want to stop for a second and take all this in."

"Well you should. I think this is one of the last fully exterior areas of the ride. From what I remember. We're about to descend into the caves. Or maybe I'm mixing this one up with the ride it was based on? There's so many of 'em, I can never keep them straight anymore."

"Here," Glyph holds out the cigar to hand back to Arieol, "Take it back. You're about to disappear again, anyway, aren't you?"

"Well, not if that's expected of me! And don't mind if I do." They snatch back the cigar, bring it to their lips, and take in yet another puff of the creamy relaxation they know so well.

"But really. Are you going to disappear?" Glyph asks again.

"Gibsey, Glyph! You need a therapist or something? Terrified of abandonment much."

"Hey now, I was just getting used to there being at least a little bit of plot. Speaking of where the hell am I to find this Oren Progresso character? And who is he exactly?"
