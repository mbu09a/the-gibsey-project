And although my ailment has to do with words, words themselves aren't the sole root of my ailment. Because my ailment also has to do with objects. It all started with objects, within objects, the words.

It will take me some time to explain. And like I said, it won't be easy.

It all started on an ordinary afternoon. I'd taken a walk around the theme park attraction where I live, the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride, one of the most iconic rides in all of the Gibsey World complex.

I take walks like this one very often, typically between the queue line and the station platform. And it's funny, I'm not even sure how I can afford to live at the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride, why there's no one either riding the ride, or in the ride queue, or how I've even come to live here exactly, let alone why I've never left. The nature of my stay, within this iconic space, how I wake and sleep and take care of myself, are all a total mystery to me.
