Over the course of our break, I discovered a contemporary novel called An Unexpected Disappearance, and its content was so strikingly relevant to our topic at hand that I knew I somehow would have to incorporate it into my lectures this evening whether I'd planned to or not. I spent most of last week trying to decide how exactly to include such digressive material into my work, but unable to think of a way, I've resorted to having to do what many of the great artists, poets, writers, musicians, and Gibsorical figures have claimed to have done after hitting such blockages of uncertainty, and I've decided to make it up as I go.

I'll also make one clarifying point before I continue. Today will be much more discussion based compared to our other classes, as well. I will not just be droning on and on like I'm known to do, and like so many of your other professors are often doing. I'll be asking a lot more questions and seeing what you have to say about a large majority of our topics, which I'm hoping can serve as a rutter of some kind if my lack of preparation starts to veer us off course.
