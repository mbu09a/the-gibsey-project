Balloons are let go. Confetti flies. Children cackle and shout. The cast members playing the parents of the children glow, seemingly full of joy for having done their sacred duty of being there, of making this sacred pilgrimage we all are gloriously compelled to make. They've come to the place, as advertised, where dreams may, in fact, come true. And the Doe family is, truly, ecstatic, as well. And even I'm fucking escatic on their behalf, for Gibsey's sake. Scrillio's reached the climax, he has, the one I needed him to reach, but he got there successfully, and fuck, I realize this may have thwarted my plans!

But I won't give up.

I can't give up.

I have to see what happens.

Sctillio's done it. He's accomplished his goal. He's finished the scene. He's made it to the end, and he even seems satisfied with it for once.

And some of the crew members are trembling with tears of exaltation.

They've never seen him this happy before.

The most magical place on earth is, in fact, here.

It really is.

Oh, and here I go Arieol.

I'm getting a little emotional over here myself, remembering it, telling you about it.

I can't help it.

You see, I'm CEO, but I have emotions.

There's nothing wrong with emotions.

And so Scrillio, the insatiable, is now satiated.

He starts apologizing to everyone, slapping crew members on the back, thanking them for missing lunch, and he calls it early for the day.

Fucking imagine that.
