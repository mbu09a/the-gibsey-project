Though, to further clarify and to be even more clear than I was before-if that is even possible-in case you didn't already notice, although, as has already been mentioned, you likely have noticed since you are a very astute reader, after all, but in case you haven't or didn't already notice, keep in mind to either remember or notice for the first time, that the initially referred to problem, the problem established by many creation myths, as well as the problem that occurs within amateur writing, the problem of assigning names to characters within an unfolding narrative or the difficulty of selecting these names among a near infinite set of possibilities, do notice and remember, being the astute reader that you are, that the earlier mentioned problem has now become temporarily resolved because The Author has now been named and identified, at least for a temporary period of time, or at least until a more proper name can be given them. However, upon mentioning this, something else may also be important to note. Do remember not to judge this author, The Author, too harshly throughout the course of their unfolding narrative because, like all authors, heroes, and landscapes at the beginning of their unfolding creation myths, they had (and have continually had) to start somewhere and will continue to do so, indefinitely, and this would mean that although they began as an amateur, much like I've begun as an amateur within this introductory and unfolding narrative, that this occurrence was one which was outside of their control.
