This is Gibsey World we're talking about.

We manufacture and decimate attention spans, simultaneously.

It's what we've always done.

Oh, and by the way, like I've said, CEOs can and do actually read.

Michael Eisner was a goddamn English major for Gibsey's sake!

I need to return to the set.

It's very Busby Berkeley-esque in style, what he's shooting, very dense, almost nauseatingly so.

I mean, the fucking budget on this thing!

Have I mentioned that?

"I'm just terrified we're going to have another one of those tragically-misunderstood-but-eventually-becomes-a-cult-classics on our fucking hands.

Those are the fucking bane of my gibseydamn executive existence.

Never make a damn profit.
