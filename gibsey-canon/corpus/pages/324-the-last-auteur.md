Oh, and I didn't mention this.

But this is where these articles have gotten him.

He's gotten to the point where thinks he needs a fucking orchestra performing on set while he's shooting the damn thing!

Did you hear what I just told you?

He thinks he needs to score the thing as it's being shot, live!

Did you hear what I just said?

Told the producers it would give the performances more of a dream-like quality. That's what he fucking said, and of course they nodded their stupid fucking heads and pretended like they knew exactly what he meant.

Gibseydamn, the fucking budget on this thing could give somebody a fucking heart attack!

And I'm medicated to kingdom come, Ariel, you know that I am.

I'm goddamn CEO!

And so the cast members continue on through the medley, the shoot, mostly in sequence by this point, which isn't really the norm, but they're doing it anyway.

You know, normally you shoot the beginning last and the ending first, that sort of thing, or you even just shoot when people are available on set, which is arbitrary. It's different every time, but Gibsey, he's the last auteur so he's gotta do it exactly the way he wants it. And they just keep performing the same parts again and again and again, doing the different parts of the same scene over and over again as they continue.
