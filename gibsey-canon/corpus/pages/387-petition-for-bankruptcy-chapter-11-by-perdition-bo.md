The events leading to this petition began with an internal dispute over intellectual property, wherein Cop-E-Right-one of the AI chatbots developed by Perdition Books-initiated legal proceedings against its fellow AI creations within the company. This unprecedented case, represented by the litigation firm Willis & Grimace, challenged traditional legal boundaries and ultimately failed to achieve resolution in the courts, casting a shadow of uncertainty and ridicule upon The Debtor. The aftermath of this legal endeavor, combined with the increasingly redundant and unoriginal content that followed, produced by the Debtor's developed AI systems-or by Cop-E-Right, if its original claim to ownership of the material produced by Mister-E-Man, Prit-E-Boi, Slop-E-Seconds, Prickle-E-Pear, and Stick-E-Situation was, in fact, correct-has resulted in a steady decline in market reception and revenue for the parent company's subsidiary.

In response to these challenges and in alignment with its commitment to its creditors, employees, and readership, Perdition Books seeks the protection and provisions afforded by Chapter 11. This petition is filed in good faith, with the intention of reevaluating and restructuring The Debtor's operations, financial commitments, and strategic direction, thereby ensuring the continued contribution of Perdition Books to the literary world.

This document serves as the formal initiation of the Chapter 11 process, outlining the circumstances that have led to this juncture and The Debtor's proposed strategy for emerging from these present challenges as a stronger, more resilient entity.
