Petey Puff's off set by now, likely taking off their costume to cry into a wine glass after having a day like today.

I mean what a fucking ass hole of a director this is, right?

But by this point, Dickey's entered and become the entire focal point of the scene, all eyes and cameras are on Dickey and Dickey alone, as they should be.

It's Dickey Dog I'm talking about here-the Dickey Dog.

He can't be ignored.

He can't be.

He jumps aboard the stationary train, the classic train of the park, of The Magical Dominion, and a family of four stands next to him, smiling from ear to ear.

'Yes we sure are happy you're here, aren't we gang? The Doe Family here, they're gonna help us get things started today! OK, alright gang, we're gonna count down from 10, just like on the Wheel of Fortune! Got it! Nice and loud, here we go! Now, everybody! And-

'10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1!

'Huh, huh! 'Welcome to The Magical Dominion, everybody!

And let me tell you, this cast member that's playing Dickey Dog is phenomenal.
