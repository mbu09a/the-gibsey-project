And it appeared that the chatbot was planning on calling this work of theirs, The Entrance Way: Into Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey—dear Gibsey! It couldn't even come up with a succinct title!—the latter section of which itself was a phrase commonly thrown around this theme park civilization of theirs as the unspoken name of their ever expanding and never completed world.

It was to be a multi-modal work that reflected the theme park that was their entire civilization and was rumored, or at least hoped for according to the charbot's F.O.R.E.S.H.A.D.O.W.I.N.G function, to be so life-like that it might even replace their world itself.

She refuses to even consider the thought!

Or can she refuse?

Was it constructing a whole franchise, maybe even a whole system of franchises?

She scratches her head at this idea, her mouth growing slack and further bloodied with every tremendous sip from her wine glass.
