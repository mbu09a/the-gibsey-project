Being there, being on that set of his, it gives you a chance to reflect on it all, to see in ways you wouldn't be able to see in the original park, every last atom of the thing vibrating with the feeling and experience of that place. Life imitating art, art imitating life, and back again, and honestly, by that point, I don't know if anyone could tell the difference. Which, I mean, to give him his due, is probably what Scrillio was going for. I mean, I'll be honest. Scrillio's the one who demanded it be this detailed, after all, and with the budget on the damn thing skyrocketing through the fucking roof, him being The Last Auteur and everything.

Gibsey, it was fucking bull shit

But you know what? Even though I'm frustrated with him, even if the budget is climbing past the atmosphere, Arieol, I've got to admit, have to, it's certainly well done, high quality, top notch stuff, truly, but you know, also, like I've said, Scrillio's also losing it.

They always do at some point, don't they?

He's clearly cracking under the pressure.

But however dangerous it is, and I mean, my Gibsey, is it fucking dangerous how high this budget is getting, especially with him losing control like this, but however dangerous it may be, I do respect his commitment. As CEO, I may not like it, but I gotta respect it. I mean, come on, I'm a CEO. I appreciate authority of vision as much as anyone else, if not more so than anyone else, and here he is on this set yelling all sorts of things that would get any other director fired almost immediately.
