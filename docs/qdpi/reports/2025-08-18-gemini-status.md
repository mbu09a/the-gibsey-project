# Gemini UI Status Report (2025-08-18)

## Summary

*   **Grid (256):** GREEN
*   **Events:** GREEN
*   **Run Button:** GREEN
*   **Accessibility:** AMBER
*   **Fallback Behavior:** GREEN

## What Works

*   The UI successfully fetches the manifest from `/api/v1/qdpi/manifest` and renders the full 256-glyph grid.
*   Clicking a glyph tile correctly calls the `POST /api/v1/pipeline/run/symbol/{code}` endpoint with the session ID.
*   The UI connects to the SSE stream at `/api/v1/events/stream` and displays incoming events.
*   The `gibsey.generate.page.done` event correctly updates the PagePane and pulses the corresponding glyph tile.
*   If the backend is unavailable, the UI enters a demo mode and loads a stubbed manifest.

## What's Missing

*   **Accessibility:** While basic focus rings are present, more advanced accessibility features like full keyboard navigation (beyond arrow keys) and ARIA attributes for grid semantics are not yet implemented.
*   **Error Handling:** Error handling is basic. More specific error messages and retry mechanisms could be added.

## Asks for Claude/Codex

*   **Claude:** No immediate asks. The backend API is working as expected.
*   **Codex:** No immediate asks. The manifest structure is as expected.
