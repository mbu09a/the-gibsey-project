"But to return back to hierarchy. Hierarchies are also linear processes. They're centered around controlling certain behaviors and maintaining and enforcing them over time. They're never about perceiving what's actually there, let alone creating or playing around with what could be there, like a child does. And that's something that Gibsey may have actually gotten right, you know, to try to be like a child again. I'm a shape-shifter Glyph. Of course I'm always looking for some sort of rebirth."

Arieol smiles again, but this time their smile seems to be trying to lessen Glyph's fear a bit more than before, maybe even showing they know they may have pushed him a bit too hard. It would seem that Arieol's even trying to maybe win him back over, but Glyph seems far too distant now, far away, complacent, not even at all fearful any longer. He's shifted, changed. At least fear and anger came with a certain degree of forward momentum, got the blood pumping. But was Glyph like all the others moving in and out of this place? Did his attention constantly shift as fast and loose as any theme park guest?

What had happened or changed?

Had an unexpected disappearance occurred?

Totally detached, Glyph finds himself drifting off into a fantasy, back at the queue line, waiting, waiting in line.
