Stillman's done well for himself.

Very high-ranking position in the ADD establishment, and as far as he could tell, much less corruption than he would have thought was necessary to reach such a lofty position, though with the compartmentalization of such a bureaucratic organization as the ADD, who knew? Maybe he'd even compartmentalized the intelligence from himself? For all he knew, maybe that was why when he walked from his bedroom to the kitchen, his legs felt like they'd been planted atop the tumbling hurl of a roller coaster, swimming up and down, G-forces and all. Might make himself sick if he isn't careful.

He tries to steady himself for a moment, hand against the Dickey Dog Seated Beneath a Palm Tree style wallpaper.

And strangely enough, the case he'd put on Glyph was already over. Whole thing was a sham. Faulty intelligence.

One could even call it artificial.
