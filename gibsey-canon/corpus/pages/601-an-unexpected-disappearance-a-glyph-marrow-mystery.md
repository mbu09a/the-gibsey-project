And at that, water rushes through the chamber of the resort room.

A flood of churning, moving, rushing water falls down upon Glyph in a great ruinous flash.

He is forced to swim.

To swim past the many bodies,

The many dead

As they pass by him

Bobbing in their watery graves.

When it shows itself, there will be no denying.

There is no denying it.

It has been here forever, and it will return again.

He swims past the floating dead through the ghosts of the Flooded Town.

Colors bleed around him.

The water is the gray of silver.

A silvered hand.

He is made of water.

He searches for air.

He wears the water's mask.

It has claimed him.
