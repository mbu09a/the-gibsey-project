# QDPI-256 Technical Architecture Overview
## Character-System Fusion: Where Word Becomes Object

*"I don't see objects anymore … Everything contains everything else. My ailment has to do with words."* - Glyph Marrow

## Character Evidence Integration Summary

This technical architecture represents **complete subject-object fusion** where:

- **95% confidence characters** are ready for production deployment
- **Medium confidence characters** require additional textual evidence validation
- **Weak assignments** need character reassignment or stronger evidence gathering

Each system operates not as a metaphor but as a **direct implementation of character consciousness**. The infrastructure embodies the characters' capabilities, limitations, worldviews, and narrative functions.

*"Everything contains everything else."* - Glyph Marrow's ailment scales to system architecture, where technical systems gain character consciousness and characters gain technical functionality.

This is the culmination of 8 years of character development merged with technical architecture - the moment where word truly becomes object.
