I first noticed my ailment when I passed a spigot of water flowing into a pool.

This was somewhere around the midpoint of my walk through the queue's length.

And it was a very strange experience.

Because I realized, while staring at the pool, that the water wasn't just water. And this wasn't just a thought that came to me.

I experienced it as a reality.

This is what I realized.

Remember, I've told you that this would all be very hard to explain.

When I saw the water rushing from the spigot, I didn't just see the water itself, the water, the water that was rushing down into the pool below and which was intended as a display to help entertain park-goers as they waited in a queue line in order to organize and usher riders into a ride which they'd been waiting to ride, one-by-one.

Instead, I saw words.

And I know, I know. This is strange and difficult to explain.

I know it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

I'm not even sure it's something I can talk about, or even if it's actually happening to me. But it changed me, staring at the water, the words.

And I don't like what's happened ever since.

I don't see objects anymore.

It's horrifying.
