The residue spews out of a hole at the top of what could easily be called the boil's head, sort of like how water shoots out of the blow-hole of a killer whale, or maybe a solo, but the thing is, this wasn't a killer whale, it was a boil, an ejaculating boil, if the image isn't already clear.

And Arieol certainly thinks of a volcano when this occurs, a specific volcano, a number of volcanoes.

They think of that column of ash and heat that crushed the Oppenheimers to death (interesting last name, huh?) that Arieol first learned about from that one Gibseyan classic Werner Herzog documentary, Into the Inferno.

They think of Pompei.

They think of Dante.

They think of Enoch.

Yeah, they definitely think of them, feel like them, twirl them around in their tongue like a mint that's about to disappear forever, thinking back to so many that are soon to be crushed over and over by the unbearable heat.

And again, Arieol hasn't even done anything.

They've just been standing there, and they also know, at least sort of know, that similar to the cannibalism from before, this never really happened.

But the imagination is a very strange and powerful thing, after all.

More real than reality itself.

And this is especially true for a shape-shifter like Arieol.
