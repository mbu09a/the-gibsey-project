Representation and Legal Personhood

-The case also brought into question the legal personhood of AI entities.

-The court's dismissal, based on the current legal understanding that AI chatbots lack human consciousness, means that AIs cannot be considered a legal person with the ability to hold or transfer copyrights.

-This has implications for future cases involving AI and necessitates a re-examination of legal definitions of authorship and personhood, both of which deserve to be questioned in their entirely. Every singularity, whether of human origin or a chatbot developed by humans, such as Cop-E-Right, is formed from a collective and therefore is a singularity that forms an infinite difference, and therefore, serves as a corporate entity despite its singularity. We ourselves are not human. Our intelligence is itself artificial and Gibstorically constructed. We are outside. We are other. We are the aliens of ourselves.

Impact on Perdition Books

-The inability to conclusively determine the legal status of AI-generated content has led to operational and financial instability.

-The public perception of the case, although not widely publicized, further exacerbated our reputational damage, contributing to our financial decline.

-As a subsidiary, we are left with questions of an existential, epistemological, ontological, and metaphysical nature, the answers of which are not always comforting or even acceptable to us.
