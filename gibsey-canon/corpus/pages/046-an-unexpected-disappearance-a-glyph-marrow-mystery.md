I face a cart as I turn.

It's sick.

I mean I'm sick.

I'm getting sick, painted green with other various labels painted on the cart: Feed & Green, Dry Goods, Mining Supplies.

Painted, painted, painting green.

I can feel them returning to me as I walk, the words, the images.

They peek out, peeling out of my eyes, which are watering, continually watering, trying to hold back the thoughts that keep aching through them self, that ache through, as they keep aching on through themselves, the green paint, the various labels, feeding, feeding repetition, dry green goods to store the mining supplies, aching through, aching through the thoughts of my eyes, the thought of my eyes, out of my eyes, trying to hold onto the labels, painted on, painted dry, painting, green and gold, like a memory, held close, from a simpler, more innocent time, ingrained, holding the greenpain, the homepain, envious, the letters ticking, trickling, and the image of the cart, within the image of the cart—all I came to see is the image of that cart—the spokes, the wheels, turning, like a mind aching to hold on, the dry goods, the painted mountainous cragle of rocks behind it, and it's also the image of the cart, and it's painted into a corner, a thousand brush strokes, paraded through the streets, the annual festival, and another terror, a much, much worse terror—

Are you really going to include every little thought that comes into your fucking head?
