All this mentioning of sky and there isn't even a cloud in it today, nothing but royal, royal blue, how regal and CEO-like, anything that can keep these characters from having to interact cause Arieol doesn't want to interact, wants to reclaim something for themself, gibeydamnit, on this farm, this older-monied land, where they're only a visitor, but truth be damned if they're going to be able to avoid it.

Progresso, poker at the fire, has started with another of his many tirades he's sure to justify with the idea of how elders and/or mentors are to be respected, and were more often respected in the much older Gibseyan doctrines.

With Progresso, everything's always justified and interesting as long as it's older, archaic, and ancient, which doesn't bother Arieol in and of itself, but it does strike them with annoyance (as really does just about anything within such a dynamic of inequity, wouldn't it?) because it reeks of absolutism. Shape-shifter that they are, nothing is inherently any way for Arieol. Well, there's plenty of inheritance around here-look who's poking at the fire-but they knew better than just about anybody that all this inheritance did was stifle and strangle the life out of all that came into its path-

But I worked for it!

They can almost hear Progresso retaliate.

Did you though?

There are plenty of signs otherwise, plenty of suggestions that Progresso's repeated attempts to seem like a work-aholic suggested something else, even if this "something else" is the same thing Arieol also wonders if he's stuck with as underling, a curse, an inability to live within one's own skin, a lack of identity (or a finalizing acceptance of one), a mask that's rooted itself to one's face for good.
