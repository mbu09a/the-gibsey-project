For example, Arieol's had to force themselves to stop looking down at the keys while typing. It's started to seem like-and there's no other way to put this folks--this trusty old keyboard of theirs is, well, breathing, that they've carved enough repetitive roadways within the neurological highway of this light-polluted mind of theirs to move outside of themselves, from within themselves, to watch their self from a distance, which is almost like cloning oneself, or one's self, come to think of it, or the technology didn't even have to be that developed even, the whole thing could even just be viewed as an extension (eek, that sounds a little too phallic, doesn't it?), or as projection, as self-projection, like throwing a spear or discus, but this time, unlike most techno-or-teleo-logical achievements more commonly known to thrust themselves across Gibstory's sweating brow, this time, it wasn't an externalization, weirdly enough, and was instead an internalizing projection that moved outward, and as has already been mentioned, in such moments, they've learnt (or learn) to project their self within themselves, maybe even more simply put-isn't brevity essential, after all?-they've learnt (or continually re-learn) one of the most classic of all Gibseyan devices, self-referentiality, if that's even a tool, per se, maybe it's more of a tendency, a neurosis, a disease, but hey, one man's molded multi-day-old Sauerkraut is another man's-actually that's just plain old disgusting-the point here being that this is one of those times where despite the stress, pain, suffering, malaise, depression, anxiety, curse, trauma, whatever you want to call it, take your pick, despite this all pressing down on them like earth atop a coffin through that revolving door of customers-and yes, they are actually out of ketchup, they're so sorry, dreadfully, painfully, please-pity-me-rather-than-judging-me-for-my-embarrassing-and-lowly-position-level sorry-that despite this furious swarm, they'll have done it enough times to finally get a chance to think within their own skull for once-by golly!-and they've gotten here all on their own, and because of that, no one can take it away from them. How's that for freedom, you dumb, tired, competitively vapid, empty-headed, baby-need-a-bottle-and-a-changey-of-your-diepy-ass-mother-fuckers!
