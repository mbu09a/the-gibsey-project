We are all haunted, horrifyingly haunted, fated to wander.

We accumulate ghosts like the falling of spring grass.

We become ghosts, livers of life in reverse, falling.

We haunt others, just as Parlance is haunted by his own family.

He is (or was) conflicted about the thought, originally mentioned, his realization of the absence of family from the story of his game, and is conflicted about it because he knows to do so, to construct such a narrative, would be too much for him, will be too much. It may even be too difficult to remember them ever again.

He would rather forget.

He will choose to forget and already has.

It is too upsetting to even remember them.

This, above all, proves his own agency, fault, blame, and guilt.

It was almost as if he lived in a world where laws themselves had been made illegal, so to be innocent, and to claim one's innocence, was to admit guilt and condemn oneself, because to claim innocence was to assume that such laws existed, to become guilty by default, a garden of good and evil, like a tyranny of choice, or like a chalice of ice melting in a green, spring meadow, waiting for someone to come upon it, to experience that eternal shock of the new, a newness itself to contrast against the newness and blankness of a dull, expected spring, a small patch of ice that could only ever melt.

There was no salvation for him.

He'd chosen damnation.

And he'd done it to himself.

And his family had agreed.

All of them, every single one of them, had agreed.
