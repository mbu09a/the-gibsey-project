But Stillman wants to be mindless.

To have the data of his head erased.

Disappeared.

He's at that stage of things.

Wishing it was him, that his face was the face that was disappearing from the minds of all who knew him, his own face, wished its ruinous mask could just blur into the luminous gray of every color and shape of the rainbow.

He's nearing the end.

The end of the line, that is.

It's strange how much a depressive thought can fling one through space.

Even the worst experience can provide one an opportunity to lose themselves.

And wasn't that what it was all about?

The loss of a self?

The mine carts of the ride pull into the station.

Stillman enters, aware that this may be his last time.

He doesn't know if he'll be able to bring himself to ride it again.

Not after all this.
