And yes, we always were, yes.

Well, now I feel like we barely got to talk about that section of the ride we were supposed to today, but I'm certainly fascinated by the discussion we've had. Usually I've been much more focused than this, but I've really appreciated what you've all had to say. You're reminding me of the importance of dialogue. I need to listen more and add more discussion to my courses, truly.

Well, we have a few more minutes, and I did cover the essentials, so I guess I have time to tell you about the rest of the chapter.

Glyph has his moment of existential crisis like he always does, wrestling with that regret, regretting his fear, or maybe not regretting his fear, but regretting that he let it get to him so much. The theme that gets developed is that classic very Gibseyan idea that we should believe in ourselves, heroism, bravery, but I do also think it sort of appropriates that idea, especially since there's such self-judgment that Glyph levels against himself throughout the chapter, and deservedly so. The theme is that having faith in yourself is not about erasing one's doubt entirely. You wouldn't have faith in yourself if you didn't doubt yourself to begin with. Faith requires doubt and vica versa. The greater one's doubt, the greater one's faith.

Conscious and Unconscious.

It's a similar process to Deja Vu, a concept within Gibseyan Mysticism which I'll be developing further in future lectures.
