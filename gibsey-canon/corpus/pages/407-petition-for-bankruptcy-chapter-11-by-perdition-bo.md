Market Strategy and Brand Rebuilding

-Rebranding Initiative: A comprehensive rebranding campaign will be launched to restore public trust and realign our brand with values of authenticity and innovation, though per market trends, this will mostly be an opportunity to increase loans and funding to line the pockets of our executives rather than to make any sincere legal or ethical considerations.

-Diversification of Portfolio: Expanding our publication portfolio to include a wider range of genres and themes, moving beyond the previous AI-centric model. However, with the human and the artificially intelligent coming increasingly closer-and-closer in contact, as well as with the rise of cloning technologies throughout our ever-expanding theme-park civilization, such variance may prove impossible to fully locate.

-Community Engagement: Increasing engagement with authors, readers, and the literary community to rebuild relationships and foster collaboration, but come on? Really, who are we kidding?
