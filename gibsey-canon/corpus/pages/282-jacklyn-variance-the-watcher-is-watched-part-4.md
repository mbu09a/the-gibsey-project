Jacklyn Variance lingers, collecting data, notebook in hand, behind Parlance. Waiting in line for the bus to the Gibsey Summers Shopping Area, always waiting in lines, varicose, clustering crowds, strollers, obnoxious toddlers, the peeling paint of the railings.

Busses sigh when they reach curbs, and so does this one, images of Dickey Dog and Neptune painted on the side. Park goers enter the threshold of the bus. Seas of t-shirts, heading to Gibsey Summers.

It is shocking that he's failed to notice Variance after the hundreds of hours of being followed. For a writer and collector of data, his skills of observation are rather flawed.

Variance notices and observes, and never stops observing; Parlance doesn't even begin to observe, simply takes up space, plops in his seat, slump-shouldered, clicking through links on his phone to ease the subtle boredom of not being in his theater seat immediately. He's lost in thought of the hype of the film, the future, the possibility of its meaning, allowing him to hover like a kind of magic carpet ride, like a bus, a transportation system, above himself, temporarily.
