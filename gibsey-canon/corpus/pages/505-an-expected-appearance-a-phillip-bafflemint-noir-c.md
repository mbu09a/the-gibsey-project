Phillip shifts his focus entirely away from his organizing and stares directly at this woman. Older, well dressed, curly colored-bright white hair, a socialite dandy-ish woman, the kind that likes to collect treasured items and who teases others incessantly Or it would seem to Phillip she was, anyway. Being a detective is quite an intuitive job, and although he does get a sense that she's been toying with him somewhat since she walkid in, he doesn't feel this woman to be a threat to either himself or the case. Though, as always with the x and y axis, only time and space would tell.

Plus he does remember vague scatterings filtering in from his earlier dream with the ear about the name "Manny Valentinas" being important, and with his dreams being a space that this woman likely wouldn't have access to, he especially perks up hearing the name repeated.

There was something to trust there, most likely, he could sense it, even if she felt untrustworthy.
