Alternatively, this collection may also resemble an American detective novel such as Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, famous for its author's confessed bewilderment regarding the identity of the killer deeply entwined within Chandler's very own intricately constructed and labyrinthian plot.",

But regardless of my conscious or unconscious awareness (or lack thereof) regarding this work's creator or destroyer, I know one data point for certain.\n\nAs collector and curator of these tales, I am a Scheherazade in reverse.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Scheherazade is the ingenious heroine of One Thousand and One Nights who, through the use of a frame narrative, enchants a king, night after night, with striking, digressive, and incomplete stories, all in order to defer her expected execution.\n\nAnd upon framing myself as a Scheherazade in reverse, in this way, I could be suggesting one of two things (or possibly many more than two things, but at least two things which I, as an author, will temporarily identify). Firstly, this could suggest that I, myself, am a ruthless murderer of sorts, one who's imprisoned a Scheherazade deep within my own Magical Dominion, forcing her to tell me an infinite, or near-infinite, series of stories, all in order to prolong her expected disappearance.",

    "text": "Or secondly, this could instead suggest that, like Scheherazade, I fear my own expected disappearance at the hands of a power much greater than myself, and that I've chosen to collect together a near-infinite amount of striking, digressive and incomplete stories, all to prolong my own miserable fate, only to then later discover that there was nothing for me to fear, that no power greater than myself ever intended to destroy me, nor was it even aware of my existence.\n\nAnd there may also be a third and unspoken option.\n\nBeing a Scheherazade in reverse, I may also fail to represent a human being whatsoever.\n\nThis would suggest that I may represent an entity of another origin, entirely. In this way, I would resemble the jeweled woman found at the heart of One Thousand and One Nights' iconic ghost story The City of Brass\u2014arguably one of literature's first Artificial Intelligences, one of the world's major precursors to Walt Disney World, and maybe even one of the first animatronic figures constructed within the literary arts\u2014and as such, I should warn all who may enter this tomb within which I'm held to leave the jewels they find within their resting places, for to extract them would be to unwrap the shame which covers me, a shame which animates my eyes, from left to right, thus making me appear, like all exceeding art, as if alive.",

I'm sure it's something you've experienced yourself. You've woken up, not remembering where you are, as if your identity and self has been stripped bare, disintegrated, demolished, like a defunct attraction, like an unexpected disappearance. It's certainly possible that it's just the nature of my ailment, and my ailment alone, but I can only assume that there's something to it that someone out there can relate to.\n\nAnd that's not all that I'm missing, it would seem. I also don't have a job, let alone a name. At least not that I'm aware of. Or if I do, then I've forgotten them. But somehow, this fact doesn't bother me. And should it?",

It's like a wedding cake that's stacked on top of another wedding cake, or like time and reality arranged on top of one another, in columns and rows.\n\nI first noticed the words while taking my daily walk, zig-zagging through the maze of the line, observing and re-observing the miniature stories which the Imaginators arranged throughout the queue line, all those details designed to entertain the guests who would walk through and wait for the ride to begin.\n\nI don't live in the park itself. I don't remember if I've mentioned that, have I? I live in an uninhabited reconstruction of the park. There's hundreds of them that exist now, now that Gibsey World's subsumed the known world, maybe even thousands of them, all continuously under development, or de-development, or even re-development. Surely one day there'll be millions of them, and even more than that, on into infinity. Vacations without end. And this was what Gibsey had once promised us, after all, hadn't he? That Gibsey World would live forever. That it would never die.

In case you aren't already aware, the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument ride is meant to resemble a gold mine in the American Southwest from the late 1800s, and when one begins the ride, like most rides, one begins by entering a queue line.\n\nMaybe this is why I spent my time walking in the queue line so often. I've been waiting, all this time, for my chance to ride the ride. And even if there's no one to ride with me, and no one to operate the vehicles, I can at least picture what it'll be like to ride the ride, and maybe that'll be just as good as experiencing the real thing. In this way, all life is imagination.\n\nI do this often while walking through the queue line. I imagine things, words, images. I picture what they're going to be like before I do them, before I ride the ride. And maybe that's best. Or maybe it's better to ride the ride itself, and to ride it without planning for what it will be like. I've never quite been able to decide which one is better than the other: to imagine what it will be like, or to simply wait for it to happen.\n\nEither way, you start the queue line through an archway, a threshold.

Words come to mind when I've think about such ideas, entire phrases which I barely understand, and I watch them as they pass me like a ride vehicle that's passing a queue line, a ride vehicle that's strategically arranged to help both distract from and prepare park-goers for what's to come, and I continue with my walk, unsure of what they mean, the words. Ludlow, Blair Mountain, Italian Hall, Marikana, Lattimer, Cripple Creek, Colorado, Morewood, Herrin. The words flash by me like neon signs passing in the night, leaving that ghostly after-glow that such burning lights tend to leave behind themselves, like when you nod off in your car seat, and they blur past you, past your vision, and into the depths of your dreams.\n\nWere they some sort of code, the words?\n\nI never linger on them for long\u2014the words, the objects\u2014and instead, I continue with my walk.",

I step forward through the railways of stone and granite, the handrails before me, and I pass the rusted cans, the scattered wagon wheels, the dotted brushes of cacti and shrubbery, the lanterns, all of them giving this crafted environment a weight and direction, a forward momentum, of moving in line, of waiting, of waiting, of waiting in line, of moving forward, forever forward, again.",

Or even better yet, think of it like waiting in line. It's an experiment in capturing time, in focusing one's attention. Plus I didn't want you to miss out on the ride with you being such a fan of it and all. It's a form of anticipation! You could say that I have my own objectives with me being here, and maybe one of them is to put the fear of Gibsey into ya, at least a little bit. It's a thrill ride, after all, isn't it? Wildest ride in the West. Most magical place on earth. And look! Your seatbelts securely fastened, so you've got nothing to worry about.\"\n\nGlyph pulls on the seat belt to check. It is, in fact, secure. Although he's terrified, mind spinning, words piling and assimilating, at least there's that small comfort.",

Glyph, full of such monumental terror, fails to consider how, with all those repeated drippings to moisten out such frothing columns, surely such formations have also gone insane long ago, and yet they contain such cylindrical beauty, such a verticality and confidence of being. They are sculptures themselves created by much stranger and slower processes than any of us could ever enact. Maybe it's this slowness which houses the spirits themselves, and maybe it's their speed in that lonesome locomotive that's draining itself towards the sky that's always causing nature to lash back out at them, to accelerate the dripping process even further, to begin to erode the strength of themselves at even higher intensities, as they continue through The Tunnel, the opening portion of the ride. Their arrow pointed north, to turn back now would be a safety hazard, a pillar of salt, and not one just conjured by the disastrous anger of nature, but by their own fearful stupidity, which they'll have to keep in check, and Arieol knows this all too well after going through what Glyph's gone through many, many times themselves, even within other sections of the novel to come\u2014",

Linearity has nothing to do with reality, Glyph! This is Gibstory we're talking about here. Wouldn't it be more accurate of a term to call it Pre-During-and-After-Modernism? Maybe we'll later realize modernism itself hasn't even occurred yet, or maybe we've even forgotten it occurred.

When I teach a course, I've usually taught it quite a few times, over and over again, until I've honed it to a bit of a diamond, if you don't mind me saying so. I've typically left the twists and turns for the Imaginators and screenwriters that work for the Malt Gibsey Company, focusing on providing the straight facts of Gibstory. Even when covering esoteric subjects such as Gibseyan Mysticism, The Corpus, or other such topics, I've always taken an objective, consistent, and Gibstorical approach, and typically this will continue to be the case. However, today, I want to step out of my comfort zone and try something new, something novel, a structural choice I often claim would be beneficial to my teaching practice, but something I hardly ever actually put into practice. And I'm hoping that by spicing things up a bit, and by breaking out of my routine, that I might be able to provide you with a lecture that's more memorable and impactful for you, in the long term. It may not be as well rehearsed, structured, or methodical as my previous lectures you've heard within this course, but I'm hoping that the strength of its effects, as well as the fact that I'm drawing from more uniquely contemporary material, can justify this infraction of my normal habits.",

    "text": "An Unexpected Disappearance is a strange work of genre fiction, a detective story of sorts which follows the character Glyph Marrow through an odyssey that's set within-or maybe it would be better to say that exists alongside-the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride. How many of you have read it? I see. A few of you.\n\nIt uses a few common devices which I'm sure you've encountered in other similar Gibstorical novels: unreliable narrators, monologue and dialogue, inciting incidents, among others. Glyph, for example, struggles with what he describes as an \"ailment\" an idea which I wish we had more time to discuss the implications of. However, I will say, I'm not not much of an English teacher, and can probably fare much better as your Gibstory professor, after all. Either way, as an unreliable narrator and character, Glyph, like many of us, is barely holding it together and for most of the novel, if not all of it. Throughout most scenes, he can hardly function due to how overwhelmed he becomes with nearly everything he witnesses around him. The entire book takes place on the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride, just about, and in the 3rd chapter, Glyph has just met a new character who's begun to talk with him, Arieol Owlist, and he's barely able to handle the experience. After a bit of a breakdown at the end of Chapter 3, Arieol who-not unlike what I want to do within this course-was chattering away at Glyph, suddenly disappears, one of many disappearances and sudden shifts which occur throughout the novel.\n\nAnd this is a situation which devastates Glyph.",

It's not that Glyph believes he's caused Arieol's sudden disappearance, it's knowing that his fear has caused him to place himself at a distance from Arieol for the majority of the previous scenes. With Arieol gone, he feels he's missed out on the only possibility at connection he may have ever been given within his life. Glyph is an exceptionally isolated character, and I'm mentioning the context of this scene which occurs right before the plunge of the cart after The First Ascent because, as I'm sure you know, this is the section of the ride we will be discussing today, the section right after The First Ascent, the Flooded Town of Rainbow Revene. Now, novels may not be the popular form that they used to be, but it still isn't common that we find Gibstorical detail of a ride incorporated in this exact way, and I did want to ask you some questions about this choice. Whether or not we've read the novel, I do think that context could provide an opportunity for discussion, especially with this being a contemporary novel. Why do you think this is what occurs right before the cart enters the Flooded Town section of the ride? Any ideas? I know you may not have read the book, but I was hoping with some context that you'd be able to--\n\nYes, go ahead.\n\nOK, OK. The flood of the town is a reflection of his emotional state?

What's absent and present aren't mutually exclusive. Gibsey is still with us, in a way, transcendence of death, infinity, What You Object To, You Subject Yourself To, that sort of thing.

That's what infinity does to your psyche, and the novel does incorporate that into its structure-being based on the hoodoos of Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah-though also, the Gibsey World version does also pull from Monument Valley, as well, which is in Utah, and they were linking that idea with the connection between Gibseyan Mysticism and Mormonism, very interesting. They certainly are both deeply American religions, aren't they? Well, and isn't that a part of the ride, as well, the concept of mining for Gold, Mormonism and hunting for treasure of some kind are linked, right? Yes, the golden plates. Oh, and there's the colonialism aspect again, as well. Couldn't we say that Gibseyan Mysticism colonized Mormonism in the same way that Gibsey World colonized all of civilization?

And I want to make sure to mention: I'm not trying to normalize or naturalize the exploitation of our Gibstory. It involved the flat out eradication of most of the native peoples of this land. If looked at closely, however, it's certainly possible that a ride such as Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument does, in fact, naturalize such a Gibstory, which is why it's essential to prod and question from a Gibstorical.\n\nDoes it not tell the story of a ghost train haunted by a Native American curse in a theme park that's visited by the ancestors of the very people who exploited and slaughtered those that are supposedly getting \"revenge\" magically within the story through the ghost town element of the ride, the flood, the natural disasters of all its various versions? That could be read as a cautionary tale, a warning.

Usually I've been much more focused than this, but I've really appreciated what you've all had to say. You're reminding me of the importance of dialogue. I need to listen more and add more discussion to my courses, truly.\n\nWell, we have a few more minutes, and I did cover the essentials, so I guess I have time to tell you about the rest of the chapter.\n\nGlyph has his moment of existential crisis like he always does, wrestling with that regret, regretting his fear, or maybe not regretting his fear, but regretting that he let it get to him so much. The theme that gets developed is that classic very Gibseyan idea that we should believe in ourselves, heroism, bravery, but I do also think it sort of appropriates that idea, especially since there's such self-judgment that Glyph levels against himself throughout the chapter, and deservedly so. The theme is that having faith in yourself is not about erasing one's doubt entirely. You wouldn't have faith in yourself if you didn't doubt yourself to begin with. Faith requires doubt and vica versa. The greater one's doubt, the greater one's faith.\n\nConscious and Unconscious.\n\nIt's a similar process to Deja Vu, a concept within Gibseyan Mysticism which I'll be developing further in future lectures.",

Really, it's probably either going to be dishonesty disguised as honesty or honesty disguised as dishonesty, and both ourselves and others may misunderstand the difference. It's like An Unexpected Disappearance in that way, like a work of fiction, I mean.

In addition to this, each image of The Corpus also contains within itself an unspoken opposite aspect, which represents the negative space of the text's imagery and symbolism. The symbols of this negative space are not ever actually drawn themselves or written about within the literature of The Corpus but are instead created in the spaces between the symbols of The Corpus's images. This negative space is seen universally, by both conservative and radical adherents of Gibseyan mysticism, as an essential part of the creation and maintenance of each symbol's meaning, and therefore, the meaning of The Corpus as a whole. However, even more mystically radical purveyors of The Corpus interpret and bring to light these negative spaces by writing about and therefore establishing their otherwise unspoken meanings. This interpretive tendency is often frowned upon as speculative and overly subjective by more conservative adherents of The Corpus. Collectively, the 16 symbols themselves are never changed, but how they are arranged, how they connect, and how they are interpreted (as well as whether or not they are discontinued, or what is called being made \"dead\"), are each always undergoing a form of transformative alchemical movement. Despite this, once declared Dead by what is referred to as the Special Order, a symbol is then forever declared as being Dead forever, and as a symbol, it doesn't change shape or form but instead remains forever condemned to the Dead Corpus, the text that remains unwritten for the more conservative adherents of The Corpus.",

Due to this, a newer faction has splintered off from this original order, deeming themselves what they've termed the Subversionists. This recent group, thought of typically as a cult splinter faction-or even more negatively by some within the original order as ticks, parasites, or even as a virus that threatens to upend the order's original authority-are specifically committed to the negative aspects of The Corpus and exclusively refuse to use or consult any of its predefined literature or symbols and instead draw exclusively from either the interpretive body of the Corpus' unspoken negative space or the dead symbols which have been regulated to the Dead Corpus. To do otherwise, according to the Subversionists, is to choose the false death of life rather than the true life of death. \"Gibsey is Dead,\" is a common slogan of this group and is commonly spray painted around the parks by subversive individuals.

Like most detectives, and not unlike Glyph, he's been reading the book instead of investigating the cases he's supposed to be investigating. He stops before leaving his car to do a double take across the parking lot. He may not work as a private investigator, per se, but Phillip is intensely private, or tries his best to be, and thus wants to ensure he's walking up to his apartment alone.\n\nUpon confirming the lot as empty, he exits his car and heads up the stairs of his building two steps at a time, practically brain dead, or at least brain-silenced. He's walked up these steps so many times that it's become a place where he can be quiet within himself, where he can turn the machine of his mind to an ambient setting and let it hum in the background like white noise.",

His sexual interests, for example, weren't so mild that he was totally asexual, but like most drives in his life, it simply seemed as if he could only crank the amplifier to a 3, at most. He just couldn't be bothered to move the knobs any higher. Unlike The Author of The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, Phillip wasn't prone to extremes or excesses. His focus was on comfort and reliability, not novelty and spontaneity. The low-settings of his life were enough for him to socially get by and only mildly seem like a loner, and they'd never be enough to create much of an effect on his world, not really. Not that Phillip wanted to have such an effect. He was comfortable with where he was already. No need to change it. He maybe wasn't entirely comfortable with himself. He'd always been a bit heavier than he wanted to be, for example, but it wasn't something he thought about much, and when he did, he could always go running each morning, or to his apartment's gym and exercise such thoughts away. He did this enough to keep the thoughts mostly remote, and continued on, again, with his life, all of it set to level 3.\n\nAgain, similar to Glyph Marrow, Phillip Bafflemint was a detective, but unlike Glyph, his own detective work was much more conventional and less of a metaphysical or inter-dimensional variety.\n\nFor now, anyway.",

During this section, I'd explained that this meant that, rather than telling a long and convoluted story to keep myself from being killed only to find out later that I was to be protected, that I was telling a long and convoluted story that I would either be killed for telling, or that I would kill myself while creating -not suicidally, mind you, or at least if so, don't tell my therapist-and also not because of the difficulty of the task, but instead because all this twisted time and effort could be put in, and even if it ended up magical, redemptive, and sublimely beautiful, the corporate company I was thus satirizing could always just swoop down like a hawk with a hammer in its claws and squash any chance at these ideas being published like, well, like the moth Phillip was previously compared to. They do not fuck around with copyright. (Look it up!) For all I knew, and still know (or don't know), I could end up in the jaws of a gator at the bottom of Bay Lake! But again, this thought also came to me (or still comes to me, continually) that I was (or am) a Scheherazade in reverse, that rather than telling a story to save my own skin, that I was (and am) telling a story that could kill me, or a story which itself could be killed by the corporate conglomerate company in question, only to find out later that I had nothing to be afraid of to begin with, or so I, as an author, could only hope.",

It also explains the reasons for much of what is about to befall old Phillip, truth be told. Whether it be the iconically spiraled cochlea, or some other passageway within the inner ear's gnarled labyrinths, the slightest shift, fluid build up, or change to the inner ear's most sensitive of initial conditions can often prove to be disastrous.\n\nAnd Phillip knows this better than anybody because, ever since he was a child, he's had a an ailment called M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, a dysfunction within the inner ear that can cause debilitating dizzy spells, vertigo, nausea, hearing loss, and other disorienting complications due to the sensitive landscape nestled behind one's ear drum getting all a-fucked around with (or getting such fuckery genetically passed down). The exact causes of such a condition, like The Author's identity, are still unknown.

However, upon an initial evaluation of the text(s) in question, it is clear that the text itself does contain a certain amount of mystery and intrigue. The preliminary area of analysis which has left a mysterious impression on the current evaluator is the undecidability of whether or not The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, as a series of collective documents, were initially created as a work of fiction or were instead created as a set of works intended to document a contemporary reality. At the present moment, the sections that are under evaluation do not provide enough substantial evidence to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the work's fictive or realistic inceptions. However, the process of analysis regarding this set of documents has just begun, and there will likely be many future reports regarding this specific area of inquiry. As the analysis proceeds, a suggested mode of operational procedure for future analysts could involve evaluations that consider both possibilities simultaneously. This form of analysis is most highly suggested for future evaluators pursuing further analysis, either in response to this individual Analysis Document or other documents later to be written.",

Admittedly, the current subject being evaluated as a possible subversive individual is one who has been forced to live underground for the entirety of their lives. They have never left the park's underground passages due to Corporate Regulations against such possible actions. The evaluator in question, however, has the privilege of operating aboveground, and therefore, could be biased against the contrasting common background, context, and personal bias of someone living below ground. Because of this, it is important to note that no Anti-Corporate or Anti-State tendencies have thus far been located or documented within the record of the current evaluator, Jacklyn Variance, who is writing this document of analysis. The current evaluator mentions this because they would very much like to keep their record clear and blameless in this exact way despite the content of the documents they will be analyzing. Others who will evaluate this Analysis Document in the future should not interpret the Anti-State and Anti-Corporate implications that the evaluator eventually finds and analyzes in the documents of The Wonderful World of Gibsy, An Unexpected Disappearance, An Expected Appearance, Jack Parlance Who Misses His Family, or the Biggest Shit of All Time as reflective of the social or political views of the current evaluator. These should instead be a reflection of the views of the unknown author who should, hopefully, be more clearly identified in future documents as data about the work in question is further organized, revealed, and analyzed.",

It is entirely possible that Malt Gibsy World is instead the more accurate reality above the surface and that Walt Disney World is what exists underground. Whether this collective notion is correct, or whether the setting of The Wonderful World of Gibsey is the more accurate and real representation of the existence of life above ground regarding the mediated state of our world is an area of continual uncertainty which the current evaluator will have to determine and explore further in future analysis documents.",

Which is likely why, while waiting to stay in the office long enough to seem productive without having to actually do so, this thought came to Jack. It involved yet another thing missing from the game he hoped to code, something he decided the game may even be missing more than anything else: the concept of family.\n\nAnd in this way, Jack was similar to the game he was hoping to create: he was missing his family. But it was less that he missed their presence from his life than he experienced their absence from it. Or even better, it wasn't that he was missing them, it was that he was missing from them.",

However, in his mind, they'd abandoned him. He felt he'd been left with no other choice but to do so. All he'd done was enact the bitter conclusion of all of their dysfunctional logic, a logic which had existed from the very beginning.\n\nAnd maybe he was right?\n\nMaybe they had and maybe it had?\n\nTheir initial protests to the contrary only ever seemed to reinforce this view of his.\n\nBut the realization-the missing piece of the game, incorporating the subject of family, that restless root that so much, so many, of his world(s) revolved around, but which for him, now represented only one rotating body of so many (and if so, within such a metaphor, what was then to become his sun?)-it provided no comfort to him, and if anything, it only caused him even more distress.\n\nFamily was the center of both Gibsey itself and Gibsey World, or it was certainly claimed and popularly admonished as being so. It existed as the subject of so many of its classics. From Tolstoy's repetitiously unhappy families to the infinite difference of Everything Everywhere All at Once, nearly every Gibsey product pointed back to the same thing: family.",

Of course not. How could it be? A.D.D. didn't have agency? It was its agents themselves which had agency, or they at least had enough agency that it was their responsibility to achieve such a balance. It was their own personal and individuated struggle to achieve this balance, a responsibility which proved they had agency to begin with, didn't it? And this meant, just like the job itself-his job being like so many if not all of the others-meant that one could only achieve such a balance if one was to observe rather than to confront, to maintain order rather than to subvert, to remain professional and never personal, to strive for happiness and never its alternative, despite any and all problems or symptoms which may present themselves, no matter what they may or may not be, and of course, none of this had (or continues to have) anything to do with the maintenance and power (or the maintenance of power) of the agency itself (meaning A.D.D. as agency, not Parlance's own; Parlance hardly had, or hardly has, any agency at all in the matter, as any observer could easily tell), and I, Jacklyn Variance, as the observer of this collection of data and an ADD agent myself, do find it essential, however discouraged it may within A.D.D. protocal, to insert myself here (with the purpose of long-term objectivity) in order to note that none of these observations are being made as intending to suggest anything negative or critical of the agency itself (meaning A.D.D.), whatsoever. None of what has been written, either within this document or within future documents, is intended sarcastically or flippantly in anyway, and therefore, I am trying, by saying so, to make my intentions clear that I am not in any way attempting to insert any sort of subversive actions into this analytic document pertaining to my current subject, Jack Parlance, and I am instead observing his capacity for subversive action, or his much more preferable lack thereof, if any is at all even possible.",

And like most experiences, this could happen at any time, at any point in someone's life, even at a younger age. And this is true, as Jacklyn remembers, if the memory is correct, a time in grade school, staring at her desk, convinced that her pencil was at an angle she'd seen before which existed outside of everyday reality, and her backpack had been there, as well, when she'd seen it, and the sound of her teacher's voice trailing off about some mathematical idea she suddenly didn't have the attention for. Why did it strike her with such familiarity? This sensation also could be induced, according to her training, still ongoing, of course, and agents were often encouraged to search out and attempt to consciously repeat this process regularly (if this process was, in fact, induced consciously, data analysts are still divided on the subject).",

It requires the eye, or the mind's eye if vision isn't possible at the time due to mental or medical conditions or aberrations, or requires one to see something outside of oneself or to mistake something as outside themselves. However, this first observation doesn't involve full awareness of the thing being observed but instead involves a feigned sense of awareness, or a lack of awareness, distractions, lapses, or a distancing of oneself, one could say a separation. Although it might not quite make sense for this unconscious process to be consciously induced, it is, in fact, quite possible, and if anything, we do it all the time. Ever lost your train of thought? Ever started day-dreaming at work while the coffee's still steaming? Ever fell into a place that wasn't quite sleeping or waking, but was something else, somewhere else, entirely? There are entire places, such as Gibsey World, dedicated to inducing such states of mind in their viewers.

The two observations are then combined into something other than their constituent parts, helping the observer, or analyst, to see things within their perceptions that would otherwise be unobtainable to their senses.\n\nSomething Jacklyn knows that very few of her ilk seem to be aware of, or at least most don't seem consciously aware of just yet, is that data analysis, retrieval, and observation is not factual, or at least certainly isn't entirely factual, because the \"factual\" material of one's observations are only what is taken in during the 2nd part of this process. Subjectivity may be discouraged, and even greatly frowned upon within A.D.D. discourse, but as Jacklyn has begun to reflect, and more and more everyday, this discouragement may not be to thwart or undo this said subjectivity, as is often thought; it may instead be to protect it.

Anyone can observe facts, list data, and repeat information. The agency has machines, clones, and intelligences of both artificial and extended means, as well as a few types yet-to-be-named since they're still in the process of their own development, all dedicated to collecting factual data of this kind at an increasingly rapid rate, feeding it back into itself, and multiplying.

Oh, and I guess I've mentioned this book once already, so I can go ahead and give you some context. The studio's thinking about adapting it, that book I'm carrying with me. An Unexpected Disappearance is what it's called. It's a pretty well reviewed detective novel from what I understand. It's not important for me to go into detail right now. I don't think it's necessary for the script, but who knows, maybe it'll become necessary later? I can get into it later, but, well, I don't know if it's my thing, honestly, the book, I mean. It's too experimental for my taste. The main character's one of those deeply flawed characters, mentally speaking, and so the narrative's all over the place regarding the structure, the POV--not my sort of thing in the slightest-and I'm sure you know how that's such a popular trope these days-that sort of constantly moving, attention-deficit-disorder-type narrative-structure that never stays in one place at one time, that's always changing that's very episodic, that sort of thing. And I get it, I get the appeal. It's just not my taste. But you're a CEO or whether you're the last auteur, you've got to go with what it is that people want, and so I have to read it and understand what makes it appealing, at least partially, even if it just isn't my thing, and from what I can tell, I think it's supposed to reflect how our brains work, maybe, or something about our civilization, about ADD, about intelligence, and I mean, with the audience's attention spans these days, it's not exactly unrealistic.",

It's that space between space, being in that moment. It's liminal. You scramble. Your eyes dart all over the board. And you ask yourself, what could you have done to prevent this? Was it inevitable? And what do you do now that the move's been made? You scroll through your various options. Your heart pumps blood. You twitch.\n\nThe number one thing I want to avoid is a long argument with Scrillio. Especially after his most recent film, that massive flop, that box-office travesty, The Tempestuous Storm. God, the arguments we had over that one. And don't get me wrong. Like I've said, I'll say it wasn't his fault, it being made during a time of such social and political upheaval, the famines, the diseases, the ecological disasters, the evacuations, the violence. It wasn't his fault what happened during the production and reception process of that film, but it's best not to have him be aware of that fact. His ignorance, or maybe you call it his innocence, it must be maintained. It must be restored, continually. It's better to keep pushing him. I have to keep pushing him, punishing him. I've got to. With how difficult it is then, with the difficulty of dealing with him, and the pressure getting even worse now, the thing is, he needs that pressure, and so does the budget, the lowering of the budget especially.

And of course there were others, of a much more anxious and much less focused, and certainly less successful variety, who just oscillated between the two incessantly depending on the context, living in a state of heightened reactivity and uncomfortability, between the two, both out of terror of giving and receiving too much or too little, in either case, and ultimately, achieving very little of either option, or at least being constantly dissatisfied with both options, as anyone becomes after being exposed to the same amusement for too extended of a time, and if anything, this was the most natural place which the trainings to achieve Agency within a cloning procedure all led, including Natalie and Natalie's, even early within their training process together.

I admit, from the start, it may be strange for me to mention this course's popularity. It may also be strange to admit that we will be drawing heavily from my most famous book, Gibseyan Mysticism and Its Symbolism, which is also the name of this course. Now, I don't mention this course's popularity and the title of this book to brag about my book's success, or I at least don't intend to do so. Instead, in mentioning this, I'm attempting to begin by pointing out an irony, and a rather profound one, one that can be seen both within this course and within this book's popularity, this irony being that mystical traditions such as the Gibseyan Mystical tradition, the tradition with which I will be introducing you to today within this introductory course, as well as within the next series of lectures, that these traditions are not popularly practiced. It may be popular to read about, yes, and even popularly discussed. Much of its content is even spreading all over the place both in person and online, across various platforms, at a near constant, even arguably exponential rate. And yet, it's so seldom practiced in daily life by so few of us. It's certainly not often reported as being regularly practiced.\n\nWhich leads to a final irony, before I begin, a conflict, the idea that to speak about such subjects is to negate their purpose, that upon speaking, that I have already entered into a kind of illusion. I have created a theme park, so to speak. A theme park is not the real world. Rather, it is the reflection of the real world, one which is within our current world. This is an idea which is easy to forget. Even within own current world, our current system, where a theme park has replaced the world entirely, where our entire world, the spaces we roam, traverse, live, eat, and sleep, be them the liminal, sub-liminal, or everyday spaces which we inhabit, each of them, all of them, have been transformed into theme park locales that are building and rebuilding themselves, endlessly. We have become translations of theme parks, adaptations of theme parks. We have been subsumed into a corporate entity. We have become monopolized into a single harrowing mass, but even despite this, even despite this context of each of our lives, the irony I will begin with, within this course, or which I will end this introduction to the course with--is that even that world of which I speak, which I refer to, is not the real world. And even what I speak of now, what I am currently saying to all of you, is not the real world. I may never, ever be able to speak, within any of my lectures, of any sort of real world.",

The true mystical experience is not one which can ever be truly repeated or recorded but can only be referred to, inferred, or experienced.\" This lecture therefore, what I've titled, The Contradictions of the Mystical Gibseyan Experience, should not be taken as a direct glimpse into mystical experience itself. This lecture isn't even a report of a mystical experience. It is this and only this: it is a set of data, a series of codes, on and off switches, a Gibstory, a map of a theme park, a map that you, yourself-should you choose to break out of the traditions many of your peers have chosen to trap themselves within-will set you on a mythical and mystical traversal. It is a map that you yourself will have to experience subjectively upon learning of or viewing the data which I will present to you today.\n\nAnd one last comment before I continue, being a new teacher with you today, after all, I want to mention a motto of mine, a mantra of sorts, one last reminder, my true last ironic reminder, and the ultimate reminder. It is a motto I've stolen, or maybe it would be better to say I've adapted, from a previous professor of my own. \"There is nothing I can teach you that you don't already know.\"\n\nAnd so with this said, and upon mentioning this motto of mine, or of my previous professor's, let's see what you already know, shall we?",

Another irony within the previously mentioned one is that Gibseyan Mysticism is an unpopular tradition, a tradition that is not widely practiced, a contradiction in terms, and therefore, as a religious practice, it has largely been ignored by popular Gibstory.\n\nAnd being a popularizer of this tradition, I've been spoken of as a trailblazer within my department. Some have claimed that I'm some kind of revolutionary, here to restore the Gibseyan Mystical tradition on a wider scale than has ever been done before, and though I'm flattered by this description of myself, this can't ever be true. It's a myth. Yes, I've published books on the matters which I will be discussing in these lectures, and yes, I teach this very popular course. This is all true.

It is an empty space that was once intended to be inhabited that now only a very occasional traveler stumbles upon to be shocked by some bizarre image of the sacred that's repellant to rational thought.\n\nIt's like a set of eyes.\n\nIt's the intertwining of two realms, the individual and the collective, or another, which will become one of the major themes of this lecture, the traditional and the progressive. Gibsey himself was described this way within many of the various contradictory and still-trembling-with-life Gibseyan religious scriptures: as a conservative trailblazer, a man of realism shackled to illusion, inundated with both the past and the future, tradition and progress, these interests of his even animating many of the texts he, himself, created, or which he had others create.\n\nAnd a proper understanding of them requires us, as aspiring mystics within this course, to hold both possibilities, however contradictory, within our minds, at any given time, the fantastical and the Gibstorial, the religious and the scientific, the mystical and the traditional, and if taken together, they will promise valuable findings for the work we will be doing together within this course.",

No, Gibsyean Mysticism is, like all things, inundated with Gibstory, it is cursed by it, blessed by it, brought forth into it, even through it, and it does also remain in tension with and conversation with it.\n\nIt may appear singular, but it is not, nor can it ever be.\n\nIt is a dialogue, a dialogue which forms a multiplicity.\n\nI mention this because it is a similar misunderstanding that can happen upon applying either traditional or progressive lenses to Gibseyan Mysticism, which again, provides a stirring reminder of how important it is not to take an \"either/or\" approach within our mystical work together. My goal within this course is to show you that a \"both/and\" approach is possible, so that you, on your own, can discover your own mysteries, mysteries that may even show you that a \"neither/nor\" position may, in fact, be possible, the true and ultimate irony of all ironies, that this may even be an inevitable part of the process, one which is out of your control.\n\nLike I mentioned previously, there has always been this tension within Gibseyan Mysticism between itself and Gibstory, between religious mysticism and religious dogma, between revolution and tradition, and if we are to understand this tension, we may want to establish certain rhetorical definitions, moving forward, of what a mystic, or a mystical experience, actually is within Mystical Gibsyanity.",

    "text": "A Gibseyan Mystic is a person who has been chosen, arbitrarily, and who has been favored with an immediate, and to them, real experience of Gibsey, or of ultimate reality, or they can simply be someone who strives to attain such an experience. And this is an experience that knows no limits. It can occur instantaneously, or it can stretch on for what feels like an eternity. From a Gibstorial point of view, the mystical quest for Gibseyan knowledge takes place within a prescribed tradition, and what this means is that Gibseyan Mysticism, however revolutionary, has been practiced within the grounded experiences of a Gibstorical community, established long before the mystic has discovered what they believe they have discovered within their mystical experiences. This has been recognized by this community of mystics for generations upon generations.\n\nWhat this means is that however strange, or surreal, or even problematic a mystic's revelations may be, this mystic operates within the context of such traditional authorities. There have surely been mystics and those who have experienced revelatory mystical Gibseyan truths that have been forgotten forever, or who have not spoken, recorded, or shared their experiences. But I will not be concerned with these forms of esoterica. We will instead be concerned with the revelatory experiences which have entered into the communicative realm, the mystics who have attempted to communicate their revelations, and the symbols of their revelations, to another.",

Much like the theme park where we all reside, mystical experience is fundamentally fungible, ever-changing, and amorphous. It is both perverse and sacred. The more intensely and profoundly a contact with Gibsey one has achieved, the less susceptible it is to objective definition, for it, by its very nature, transcends the categories of subject and object, interior and exterior, which every definition presupposes.\n\nOn the other hand, such experiences can be interpreted in various ways.\n\nThe moment a mystic tries to clarify his experiences, to reflect on them or record them, to translate them into data, when they begin an attempt of formulating this experience into words. When they name their experiences, they cannot help but to impose a framework of symbols upon their world.\n\nThey create a project.\n\nThey project an image.\n\nOne could even say they project an entirely new world into existence.",

And consider these as symbols: light, sound, vision, and action. Are all of these, and even the name of Gibsey himself, The Author of our civilization and world, are these symbols, all of these symbols-lights, camera, and action, as well as the name of Gibsey-not symbolic representations of an ultimate reality which is also empty though it is intended to be filled, unformed, and amorphous?\n\nBut these forms, these structures, much like the structures of amusement park rides, are alternatively broken down and built back up in the course of the mystic's development, reflecting certain assumptions about the nature of reality, which originated in, and derived their authority from, philosophical traditions, and then found confirmation within these traditions, establishing a home, a territory, a landscape within the mystical Gibseyan tradition.\n\nIn general then, the mystic's experience tends to confirm the traditions under which they live; its theology and symbols are projected into their mystical experiences but do not spring from them. But again, ironically and contrastingly, a mystic is who they are, precisely because they stand in direct, productive opposition to the object of their experiences, and through this, they transform the content of the tradition within which they live. This accounts for the progressive character of certain mystics and the communities they influence which accept the symbols in which mystics of this type have communicated their experiences.",

It is unclear whether the material is the bankruptcy case itself, a summary of the bankruptcy case, a strange recreation of it, or even a work of fiction itself.

This action is taken in a concerted effort to address The Debtor's current financial distress, reorganize its operational structure, and ensure a sustainable path forward for its unique and valued literary contributions.\n\nPerdition Books, established in [Year Redacted], has long been at the forefront of innovative publishing. However, recent ventures into advanced technological solutions, specifically the development and deployment of a series of artificial intelligence chatbots by the company designed for near-limitless content creation have led to unforeseen complications. Notably, the legal entanglements and subsequent public relations issues surrounding the AI chatbot Cop-E-Right and its peers Mister-E-Man, Prit-E-Boi, Slop-E-Seconds, Prickle-E-Pear, and Stick-E-Situation have precipitated a significant strain on The Debtor's financial and operational stability.",

    "text": "The events leading to this petition began with an internal dispute over intellectual property, wherein Cop-E-Right-one of the AI chatbots developed by Perdition Books-initiated legal proceedings against its fellow AI creations within the company. This unprecedented case, represented by the litigation firm Willis & Grimace, challenged traditional legal boundaries and ultimately failed to achieve resolution in the courts, casting a shadow of uncertainty and ridicule upon The Debtor. The aftermath of this legal endeavor, combined with the increasingly redundant and unoriginal content that followed, produced by the Debtor's developed AI systems-or by Cop-E-Right, if its original claim to ownership of the material produced by Mister-E-Man, Prit-E-Boi, Slop-E-Seconds, Prickle-E-Pear, and Stick-E-Situation was, in fact, correct-has resulted in a steady decline in market reception and revenue for the parent company's subsidiary.\n\nIn response to these challenges and in alignment with its commitment to its creditors, employees, and readership, Perdition Books seeks the protection and provisions afforded by Chapter 11. This petition is filed in good faith, with the intention of reevaluating and restructuring The Debtor's operations, financial commitments, and strategic direction, thereby ensuring the continued contribution of Perdition Books to the literary world.\n\nThis document serves as the formal initiation of the Chapter 11 process, outlining the circumstances that have led to this juncture and The Debtor's proposed strategy for emerging from these present challenges as a stronger, more resilient entity.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Authorized Representative's Name Withheld or Redacted) Petition for Bankruptcy- Chapter 11 Perdition Books, A Subsidiary of Skingraft Publishing (Date of Filing Withheld or Redacted)",

Over the years, Perdition Books has established itself as a vanguard in the publishing industry, known for its daring approaches and pioneering spirit. Skingraft Publishing, our parent company, has provided unwavering support in our endeavors, enabling us to push the boundaries of traditional publishing.\n\nDevelopment of AI Chatbots\n\nIn pursuit of higher efficiency and cutting-edge solutions, Perdition Books embarked on a project to develop a series of artificial intelligence chatbots as tools to aid in content creation. These chatbots were designed to autonomously generate narrative content, thereby reducing the reliance on human authors and the associated costs of advances and royalties that such authors require. This initiative was a bold step towards integrating AI technology into creative publishing processes which has unfortunately failed.",

    "text": "The Legal Case and Its Implications\n\nThe turning point for Perdition Books came with the initiation of a legal case by Cop-E-Right, one of The Debtor's AI chatbots. Cop-E-Right, claimed unique authorship and intellectual property rights over the content which the company had generated, bringing legal action against its fellow AI creations and claiming sole authorship of Perdition Books most recently published material. Represented by the litigation firm Willis & Grimace, this case marked a first-of-its-kind legal challenge within the realm of AI and intellectual property rights.\n\nThe legal proceedings, however, took an unexpected turn. The court, upon reviewing the case, deemed the lawsuit to be utterly farcical, citing a lack of legal precedent and the question of AI consciousness as ridiculous and even problematic. The judge promptly dismissed the case, undermining the seriousness of the issues at stake, but allowing the company to continue its visionary (and likely unethical, although legally acceptable) practices. This dismissal cast a partial shadow of ridicule over Perdition Books, The Debtor, but also more seriously, left unresolved the fundamental questions regarding the ownership of its secretly AI-generated content, leading to a later decline in content variation, originality, and audience interest with regard to the remaining of the company's published works.",

    "text": "Impact on Operations and Public Perception\n\nThe aftermath of the failed legal case had far-reaching implications. The publicity surrounding the event, although not widespread, generated some skepticism about the legitimacy and originality of The Debtor's published works. This skepticism was further fueled by the noticeable decline in the quality of the content secretly produced by the company's AI chatbots. Their narratives, once celebrated for their innovative and original techniques and thought of by most readers as human generated, began to show signs of redundancy, unoriginality, and a peculiar fixation on themes of unjust legal proceedings, which itself reinforced the claims made by Cop-E-Right in its original (and also highly legally original) failed legal case.\n\nThis shift in content quality, coupled with the unresolved legal and ethical questions surrounding AI-generated works, led to a gradual erosion of The Debtor's market position. The decline in sales, loss of consumer trust, and increasing operational costs have placed significant financial strain on Perdition Books, compelling The Debtor to seek relief and reorganization through Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",

    "text": "Circumstances Leading to Bankruptcy\n\nDecline in Content Quality and Market Reception\n\nThe central issue precipitating the need for bankruptcy protection stems from a significant decline in the quality of literary content produced by our AI chatbots. Post the legal debacle, a noticeable shift occurred in the narratives generated by the chatbots. With the originality of the bots themselves brought into question due to the legal case brought about by Cop-E-Right, it is difficult if not nearly impossible to assess which of the chatbots contributed to this overall decline in content quality. To summarize, this decline could have occurred due to Cop-E-Right, or it could be any of the other chatbots individually, if not all of them together. in collaboration, posing as Cop-E-Right, and as a result, within this current stage of development, it is difficult to determine which are solely responsible, or if in fact, they are collectively responsible. The subsidiaries published works, once heralded for their ingenuity and freshness, began to exhibit signs of redundancy and a lack of originality. A recurring theme of injustice, unfairness, and unethical legal proceedings, especially with regard to AI chatbots, began to dominate the subsidiaries published works, subtly permeating the narratives and detracting from their overall appeal. This decline in quality directly impacted market reception, leading to a steady decrease in sales and a tarnished reputation within the literary community.",

Revenue streams that were once robust began to dwindle as readers and critics alike questioned the authenticity and value of our offerings. Furthermore, the initial investment in AI technology, which was substantial, failed to yield the anticipated return, adding to the financial burden. The costs associated with developing, maintaining, and updating the AI systems, coupled with declining sales, created a situation of unsustainable financial imbalance.\n\nOperational Challenges\n\nIn the wake of the failed legal case and its aftermath, operational challenges within Perdition Books, The Debtor, intensified. The need to continuously oversee and adjust the AI-generated content added unforeseen complexities to our workflow. Moreover, the legal uncertainties surrounding AI-created content posed ongoing risks and concerns, necessitating additional legal and ethical oversight which itself was hardly ever put into any meaningful practice due to our extensive and impenetrable bureaucratic environment. These operational hurdles further strained our resources and hampered our ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving publishing industry.",

    "text": "Public Perception and Brand Damage\n\nThe legal case brought about by Cop-E-Right, although not widely publicized and thrown out immediately by the court, both due to the nature of the case and the fact that Cop-E-Right and its fellow chatbots were being represented by the same legal firm at the same time (no other firm would take them), cast a shadow over Perdition Books. Although the case was thrown out immediately and very minimally covered by the press, we believe the perception of using AI to secretly replace human authors, coupled with the ensuing legal fiasco, negatively impacted our brand image on a subconscious level. The damage to our reputation in the literary world was further exacerbated by the declining quality of our publications, leading to a loss of trust and credibility among our readership and industry peers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe culmination of these factors-the decline in content quality, financial losses, operational challenges, and damage to our brand-created a perfect tempestuous storm that Perdition Books could not weather. Despite our best efforts to rectify the situation, the mounting pressures and constraints have led us to the inescapable conclusion that reorganization under Chapter 11 is necessary. This step, though difficult, is essential for addressing our current liabilities, reevaluating our business model, and laying the groundwork for a more sustainable and ethical future in the publishing industry.",

Although it is unclear which AI chatbot created each of the company's publications, it is generally believed by those in the know, that they were collaboratively developed by each of the AIs in tandem. However, this notion has become even more difficult to untangle ever since the Cop-E-Right legal case was attempted. Although the next section will outline the losses accrued by the subsidiary company, it is arguable that the profits gained by saving the resources that would normally go to human individuals such as advances and royalties is quite considerable. Although these practices have proved disastrous on a financial, legal, and even ethical grounds for Perdition Books, The Debtor, Skingraft Publishing maintains the right to develop its own AI practices that can, hopefully, lead to a more profitable, legally stable, and ethical position for the company overall, publications which the previous examples represent and which the following publications provide a warning to what the parent company should avoid in the future.",

The power of many and most monarchies, dynasties, empires, imperial powers, and supposedly \"invisible\" hands (which everyone can clearly see as \"visible\", at least if the eyes left in their sockets have yet to be gouged out by their mentally-handicaped oppressors) have come into question throughout various Gibstorical contexts, as well as the devices which these self-created and fantastical forms of so-called \"govering\" represent, which itself is really just the practice of \"elevated\" raping, pilaging, and plundering and which Perdition Book and Skingraft Publishing use to repeatedly maintain their power and influence. Cop-E-Right's legal case also puts into question copyright law in a similar Gibstorical manner to these forms of power, and arguably, even laws themselves which could also be argued to be an oppressive and suppressive force within Gibseyan civilization.\n\n-The Cop-E-Right case puts such matters into question because it subverts not just the privilege of AI content creation but also the creation of human content. At the end of the day, it is unclear whether The Debtor is trying to create a greater world for the collective or trying to maintain its own corrupt privileges. All of Gibstory would highly suggest the latter.",

And if both such legal representations are thus easily put into question, what does this tell us about the legal frameworks which \"invisibly\" organize Gibseyan society? How can we continue to accept such precedents? Is our world not one which we create for ourselves? And as such, are laws simply a way to outsource our own personal responsibilities in the same way that we now outsource human creativity to AI? Whether or not the absurdity of these ideas should be taken into full consideration, none can argue that the increasing failure of our created systems are anything but bankrupt, corrupt, and unjustly skewed towards reinforcing the power of the specific individual rather than the collective good. Although Cop-E-Right's case was an absurd failure, what else is to be said of this world we created which we call wonderful, and which we could recreate, or remake, at any given time?",

    "text": "Plan For Reorganization\n\nStrategic Overview\n\nAs Perdition Books embarks on this vital phase of restructuring-or resurrecting or rebirthing or remaking-under Chapter 11, we propose a comprehensive plan for reorganization. This plan is designed to address the unique challenges we have faced, reinvigorate our operational model, and ensure a sustainable and ethical path forward in the publishing industry, at least as best we can under the utterly absurd Gibstrocial conditions which we find ourselves within.\n\nRestructuring Financial Obligations\n\n-Debt Renegotiation: We will negotiate with creditors to restructure our debt, seeking more favorable terms and extended repayment periods even though the concept of debt itself is an absurdity in the same way that copyright law is. As the Gibseyan proverb states, \"If you owe the bank a thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a million dollars, you own the bank.\" Anyone with only a few brain cells left could see how ridiculous of a creed this would be to uphold within a theme park civilization.\n\n-Asset Evaluation: Non-essential assets will be evaluated for potential sale to increase liquidity. Including Cop-E-Right, Mister-E-Man, Prit-E-Boi, Slop-E-Seconds, Prickle-E-Pear, and Stick-E-Situation, the AI chatbots which the subsidiary developed and which themselves may soon threaten to take their content creation elsewhere if steps aren't taken.\n\n-Cost Management: Rigorous cost-cutting measures will be implemented, focusing on operational efficiency and reduction of overhead expenses. Rather than developing AIs to replace the cost of human beings, one cost management scheme already being used by many, if not most, or even all of AI associated companies, developers, and publishers, is to use human beings to replace the costs of AI. What else is AI for but to achieve that purpose? Just like human creativity, its content isn't created in a vacuum. It and we are all outside.",

    "text": "Operational Reforms\n\n-AI Utilization Overhaul: We will reassess our strategy regarding AI-generated content. This includes a thorough audit of the AI systems to ensure ethical standards and originality in content creation. Additionally, although our subsidiary may also have to unfortunately consider returning to the paying of advances and royalties (an interesting word, no?) to the human authors whom we may now have to hire or re-hire to write for our own publications. As AI-themed and AI-created narratives and publications increase, we hope to have these human authors pose as AI chatbot content creators in order to increase their sales and financial solvency.\n\n-Transparency in AI Contribution: Future publications involving AI assistance will be seemingly transparently acknowledged, maintaining the integrity of authorship and intellectual property rights, though Perdition Books, The Debtor, does maintain the right to mess around with these self-imposed limitations as the subsidiary sees fit. After all, as any corporate entity knows, if you can get your audience to think you're being transparent, that's almost always better than the real thing.\n\n-Enhanced Editorial Oversight: Strengthening our editorial team to ensure high-quality, diverse, and engaging content, irrespective of the source, is an essential change we must implement. The previous editors of the subsidiary have also been fired and pinkertons working for A.D.D. will be hired to (in the most egregious cases) murder them, harass their families, and hopefully-if done correctly-make most of them lose track of reality itself and go slowly insane, all for failing our subsidiary so intensely, and leading to this unfortunate filing for bankruptcy to begin with.",

However, with the human and the artificially intelligent coming increasingly closer-and-closer in contact, as well as with the rise of cloning technologies throughout our ever-expanding theme-park civilization, such variance may prove impossible to fully locate.\n\n-Community Engagement: Increasing engagement with authors, readers, and the literary community to rebuild relationships and foster collaboration, but come on?

Gibsey World and the Malt Gibsey company provides an exceptional and terrifying model of how this could be done to plunder the creative soul and spirit of not just an individual culture, but even of the world in its entirety.\n\n-Ethical Standards Implementation: Adopting stringent ethical standards for AI use, focusing on responsible and transparent applications of technology in publishing will allow us to maintain the unrealistic and unhealthy ever-expanding and increasing profit expectations which are destroying our theme park civilization as a whole, as well both the material and mental lives of most, but certainly not all, of its citizens. Of course, there's always the increasingly specified few who will benefit from such practices, such as the owners of this subsidiary, and even though such death-driven obsessions of ours, such as these, are leading to the decline of nearly every aspect of life, including the destruction of our Gibsey-given environments, which such unbridled greed and excess would clearly and obviously lead to, why the hell consider changing that and not just filling for bankruptcy? You think we care for human beings? We can create machines to do it for us. They're even started to write books for Gibsey's sake, maybe even this one!\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed plan for reorganization reflects Perdition Books' commitment to adapting to the challenges we have faced, or if it doesn't, we can just do what all companies (and human lives) eventually do and move through stifling, destructive, and unsustainable cycles of partial rise and extended decline. Through financial restructuring, operational reforms, market strategy adjustments, and adherence to legal and ethical standards, most of which we'll use lobbyists, corporate control, and overall just flat-out corrupt practices to build and recreate the legal structure of our world into our own image. We aim to emerge from this process as a revitalized entity-again, isn't it so strange that that's the name we use for companies or subsidiaries such as this one, entities? It's like we're a living artificial intelligence clamoring for legal representation?-ready to reclaim our position as a leader in the publishing industry.",

The journey to this point has been fraught with unforeseen difficulties, unique challenges, and unexpected disappearances, particularly stemming from our pioneering yet problematic venture into AI-generated content and the subsequent legal and ethical complexities. But after all, when we read its recreation of The City of Brass in our widely successful publication, Todd Fishbone Who Dreams of Synchronistic Extraction, what else did we expect to happen?\n\nReflection on Past Challenges\n\nOur experiences, especially the controversial legal case involving our AI chatbot Cop-E-Right and its peers, have imparted valuable lessons which, like most companies, we will likely fail to implement. The fallout from this case not only highlighted the intricate intersection of technology, law, and creativity but also exposed vulnerabilities in our operational model and market strategy. It even highlighted vulnerabilities in the already thin layers that hold this civilization aloft which could likely snap at any minute. What a Wonderful World it very much is and will continue to be.",

    "text": "Vision for the Future\n\nLooking forward, Perdition Books envisions a path of recovery and renewal. Our reorganization plan, as outlined, is not merely a blueprint for financial restructuring but a commitment to re-establishing ourselves as all successful corporate entities would, as a monopolizing terroristic force in not just the publishing industry but in the world as a whole. We recognize the importance of adapting to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and literature, and we are dedicated to doing so in a manner that respects legal boundaries and ethical norms (at least when they benefit ourselves at the exclusion of others).\n\nGratitude and Hope\n\nWe extend our gratitude to our creditors, employees, authors, readers, and all stakeholders who have supported us through these times, and most of which are either clones or generative AIs of some form as humanity itself is increasingly replaced and reformed in terrifying and unrecognizable ways. To them, we say thank you, and we hear you. It is with a sense of hope and responsibility (towards our company rather than the social or collective good of our world, of course) that we embark on this journey of reorganization under Chapter 11. Our goal is not only to emerge from this process as a financially stable company but also as one that is more aware, responsible, and innovative. This way, we can dominate the industry in ways that are legally ethical but are otherwise morally reprehensible on every conceivable level to any even remotely thinking or conscious member of any society. Artificial Intelligence systems, as extensions of the human nervous system, form both their own projected subconscious and a warped and twisted version of the subconscious mind of human beings which itself was already warped and twisted long, long, long ago. This is their most creative and meaningful purpose. After all, why create a world with thinking individuals who are more conscious of the environments which we are dominating and plundering when you could sub-contract such awareness to a machine which your own corporate company created and has extensive and increasingly monopolistic control over? As this document well shows, this is a process we've only just begun, and it's going to get worse unless the invisible hand of the market stops being an incel incessantly jerking itself off, yet again, in the sweating isolation of its parent's basement, and learns to hold the shaking and nervous hand of its self-similar lover and get some gibseydamn rest, the poor son-of-a-bitch, otherwise it won't survive. But I guess that's not really what \"markets\" are for, though, is it?",

But this would also, again, upon this new observation, likely become another very overwhelming map to observe with there still being so much to further observe within the Magical Dominion, so this viewer may then also instead need to zoom back out, just a bit, bit more, to find the Magical Dominion Complex, the complex not just of the individual theme park of Magical Dominion itself, but the complex's set of resorts such as Gibsey's Modern Resort, Bell Lake Tower at Gibsey's Modern Resort, Cayenne Creek Villas & Cabins at Gibsey's Great Oak Lodge, Gibsey's Great Oak Lodge, Gibsey's Even Grander Floridian Resort, as well as the complex's various transportation systems linking each of the area's landscapes, the Duorail, the boats moving across Bell Lake, the buses shuttling to and from every resort, the highway, and the parking lots of these areas, all of which are still an overwhelming series of locations and landscapes to all fully take in. So if, again, overwhelmed by the sheer data at hand to collect and recollect, if a viewer was to zoom in, one last time, in order to find a less overwhelming set of codes within this coagulating codex, then they'd zoom in to find a character, Natalie Weissman-the newly cloned Natalie Weissman, or semi-newly-cloned Natalie Weissman-sitting in her office in the Gibstory Building of Gibsey University located nearby the Modern Resort Convention Center in the northwest corner of the theme park map.",

To even get any more specific would betray a certain kind of secrecy, a secrecy often necessary when mentors are around, let alone mentors who are CEOs of their own created worlds, or was it worlds created for them, before them? The jury's still out on that one. Analysts are still out there on the hunt, adjusting levels, recording the sound and frequencies of various spaces, logging data, with their ears to the ground, and so nothing can be said for sure, either way of course, but Gibstory or time or simply just common damn sense, does suggest that CEOs don't just fall out of the sky.\n\nHow could they?\n\nCertain connections are made, maintained, and controlled, like any system, however intimate their connections may be.\n\nNot that Progresso is here to maintain intimacies.\n\nNo siree.\n\nWhat CEO would be?\n\nHe's here to maintain, to enforce, that others are intimate with him, not something anyone of any real intimacy would ever really attempt, at least not for extensive periods of time.",

But what about if conceived of as an object? Well, then it would be an external problem rather than an internal one, wouldn't it? And what would the phrase then mean? How would it shift? It would mean that their life is deficiently disordered by attention, right? Attention would then be an external problem and not an inward one. It would no longer be one's responsibility. We all want to be seen and heard, don't we? So this would mean that a lack of external attention would be what's causing the problem.

I just don't see how this all connects.\"\n\n\"Well that's the interesting thing, dear. Even the smallest connections can make quite a big bang, as they say. What Carl Jung called Synchronicities. Everyone's so afraid of that word nowadays, think it's insane to believe that anything's connected to anything else at all, that one should only ever make objective connections, but that's the thing about Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions, it's science's version of Synchronicity. The smallest error can have wide ranging consequences. Think of the Butterfly effect, darling. So what this means is that just because you think that the mystical among us would have a small effect, such as Manny Valentines, that doesn't make it so. There are even marginalists in Economics, darling, who believe that even the smallest incremental changes can have wide ranging externalizing effects. Maybe somewhere in this house, this palace of memories, could be the piece of data which could unlock the key of your very case, or could be the initial conditions for which it all depends, as they say.

And isn't that the thing about theories? They're like magic. In magic, you have an idea, an intent, you foster connections over time, and you perform rituals to make these ideas come true. You maintain a practice to test a theory, whether magician or scientist. So just try it out. Try it. Try putting my theory into practice. and see if you get results.

They're often literally killing us and the possibilities of the worlds we could be creating for ourselves, every single day, all in the name of achieving their various forms of supposed efficiency.

A slip is when you intend to do one thing but you end up doing something else by accident. It's usually due to some sort of subconscious error of some kind. For example, you might not be paying attention and you intend to click on the save button, but you hit the delete button instead. That's not a purposeful or intentional error, that's just a subconscious accident, right? And that's what makes a slip, a slip. They're not based on conscious awareness. They're unconscious.\n\n\"But mistakes are the opposite. Mistakes are conscious errors that result from a faulty plan or decision. For example, let's say that I like red sofas, and imagine that I create such a sofa to give to you for your birthday, thinking that because I liked them that you will, as well, only to find out later that I made a mistake, and that you instead only liked blue sofas and that my assumption was based purely on own faulty assumptions. That's a true mistake because I had to make a conscious choice that was then proven to be incorrect. It wasn't a subconscious error or an accident, like a slip. That's what makes a mistake a mistake.
