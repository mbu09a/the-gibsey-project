Ok, Ok. And they come upon a couple other things in this tomb.

But they're all very similar to each other from what he remembers. It's a little repetitive, yep, yep.

And so they continue on for 3 days and come upon a tall hill whereupon stands a horseman made of brass-oh, wait? Was this the automaton? Finally! But wait no, no? Wait? What the hell? Was that not the City of Brass they just came from? This is so weird? Wait, is there, huh? Is there, like, a doubling thing that happens in this?

Maybe he just didn't remember?

Well, anyway, better keep going, but wait? No, he thought that was The City of Brass they were just in? I was sure of it? What the hell?

Oh, well, anyway, so again, they come upon this horseman made of brass and on it is some sort of engraving that's like, "Hey! If you don't know where the City of Brass is, then rub the hand of this rider and it points you in the right direction," and so they do, and it does.

Damn, he could've sworn that was The City of Brass before? It was so similar to what he remembered it being like when he first read this? Weird. Ok, and it looks like the Scherazade frame narrative interrupts again. Eh, I'll just skip it when it comes up. Doesn't feel necessary. Everybody remembers that story. It's just here for framing purposes, right?
