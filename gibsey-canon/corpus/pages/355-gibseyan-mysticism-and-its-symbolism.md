Ever since the procedure, Natalie Weissman--the original Natalie Weissman-spends most of her time in bed, processing and reprocessing the various idiosyncrasies of her past trauma. Being the first and original version of herself to adopt the cloned representation technology now becoming the rage for many of her class, what else did she have to do with her time? And although this syncopated and depressive pattern of hers, with its accumulating negative signs and symptoms, was clearly not ideal, she could admit it did come with its own benefits, the most consistent of which being that it would alway provide her with something new with which she could think about, at any given time.

Today, she thinks of her grandparents, both of them, when they'd reached the end of their lives. The various hospitals and old folks centers she'd visited, usually with her mother, the dank smell of loneliness that had dominated the hallways, the wrinkled skin and boney fingers. the hallowed out look of burdening dementia, the floating forgetfulness, lathering itself, progressively, across every layer of their final experiences.
