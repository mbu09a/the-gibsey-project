"Do you mean that you're hallucinating?"

"Well, I don't know? I mean, a clipboard is there, in your hand, isn't it? Please tell me a clipboard is in your hand."

"Yes, this is definitely a clipboard." He holds it up, moving it around as if that helps give it substance.

It doesn't, and it also does.

It's horrifying.

"Oh, thank Gibsey."

"Are you saying the words are superimposed on top of the objects you're seeing, like a hologram or something? Are you sure this isn't a hallucination?"

Now that I think about what he said, what did he mean by that exactly? What does it feel like to have a hallucination and know that you're hallucinating? A hallucination is the sensation of perceiving something that isn't there, isn't it? I suppose I've noticed them before, possibly, but to notice a hallucination, wouldn't it no longer be considered hallucination? Or is it only when you notice and wish you'd never noticed at all?

Was it my definition of hallucination which was faulty?

How I'd understood the meaning of the word?
