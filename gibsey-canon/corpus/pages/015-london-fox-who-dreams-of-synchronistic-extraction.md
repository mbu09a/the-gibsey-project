Before pouring her now third glass of wine, she'd first been pouring over Synchromy-S.S.S.T.E.R.Y's most recent textual creation, An Unexpected Disappearance, a Glyph Marrow Mystery, which itself had appeared to be a smaller gestaltic piece of a larger whole.

And the Chatbot appeared to have gone further, making this novel within its novel even more novel by transforming it into an application of some kind, one that when accessed by users—she was still unsure if she was the only one who would ever access such creations and increasingly hoped she would be the only one—generated story upon story upon story, and stories within these same stories which themselves generated other stories, ad nauseum.

What had she expected to happen when committing to creating such a generative model?

And there were many more stories to come.
