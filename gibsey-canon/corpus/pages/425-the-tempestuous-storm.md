Her first original memory, or at least what she perceived as such, first came to her through speckled tremors of light, the kind of light which dance off the crystal surface of wind chimes and that sputter such memories into wide-eyed, localized motion, and the memory itself (or the transition which led her to form this memory, depending on your POV), through montage, led to another set of wind chimes, this set of wind chimes which became her first original memory, but which of course, when she thinks about it now through that progressive piling of days-oh, those ruinous stacks- she recognizes that she can't really tell the images apart from each other, that they've blended into one another, clumping into each other like finger-paint on transparent glass, like leaves swirling through gusts, or like her own breath--another memory, which came to her later, originally or not-that she held to her chest to see how long she could hold it there, stifling, struggling, heaving into (or in) that column of her own air, her breathing, her breathing, before stopping herself and letting it all go.
