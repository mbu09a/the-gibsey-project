No matter what, you stare forward throughout the course of the ride. There's no looking back.

The cart chatters, an attempt at communication, and its chattering blends with the sounds of the animatronic bats, the flapping of their wings, their squeaks and chirps, the fluttering of their invisible sonar bouncing off the waves of granite eroding at the heart of this tunnel that's leading them to The First Ascent.

The vehicle reaches the base of a small incline, then rifles through a left turn and out of The Tunnel, and into the light.

The sun envelops them as the vehicle clicks right past a series of monument formations down a small hill into what looks to be recreations of Death Valley—interesting name—orange-red as the sun licking the horizon, a few cacti arranged in a predetermined set of rows that's been more obviously designed than the rest of these unnatural naturalizations. They wind through other various tunnels, monuments, the white lines stretching around the orange crags of the various rock formations, again through all those tamed tan erosions, and wind through little whips of up and down hills and shaky turns.
