"In design theory, there are two types of errors: there's slips and there's mistakes, and both come down to an attention problem. Attentional deficits doing what they do best, right? A slip is when you intend to do one thing but you end up doing something else by accident. It's usually due to some sort of subconscious error of some kind. For example, you might not be paying attention and you intend to click on the save button, but you hit the delete button instead. That's not a purposeful or intentional error, that's just a subconscious accident, right? And that's what makes a slip, a slip. They're not based on conscious awareness. They're unconscious.

"But mistakes are the opposite. Mistakes are conscious errors that result from a faulty plan or decision. For example, let's say that I like red sofas, and imagine that I create such a sofa to give to you for your birthday, thinking that because I liked them that you will, as well, only to find out later that I made a mistake, and that you instead only liked blue sofas and that my assumption was based purely on own faulty assumptions. That's a true mistake because I had to make a conscious choice that was then proven to be incorrect. It wasn't a subconscious error or an accident, like a slip. That's what makes a mistake a mistake. It's conscious. Am I making sense?"
