And like all children, they grow up to become just like their parents, products of their various loves and hatreds, to have children of their own, to fall back into themselves, creating families, these families creating other families, form animating, like a grid, or like a chart, a network of connecting nodes, some nodes-like the branches of trees-breaking off, splintering, and others, blooming, like fungus, or like moss, multiplying itself, and this growth is a growth that will never end.

The rings beneath their roots ring out a like a choir that can never stop singing, that can't even if it tried-and it always does, try-like voices ringing, voices ringing out, both spoken and unspoken, sound trailing through the clouds of a sky that appears as night, waves, refracted through the prisms of endless sets of eyes, moving, behind her own, Natalie's eyes, as she slept, as she sleeps, her eyelids, moving, underneath, within an eternal darkness, to wake, and upon waking, the dream, it was only ever returned to her, this dream, only ever came to her in pieces, in fragments, fragments that longed to be known, longing to be known, to be seen and connected, and even with Natalie's recent abundance of time, there would never be, could never be, enough time to connect them, all of them, to one another.
