Scrillio directs the scene, in the state he's in, as best he can.

I think it's the intro theme song section in particular he's directing by this point? Clearly trying to hide that he's terrified that I'm there, that I'm on set, watching him, but I know what's been going on.

I've heard the rumors.

They've spread like vines, like viruses.

He can't fool me, and he especially can't fool his crew members.

He's losing it.

All that pressure he and all the articles are putting on himself, it's too much for any one man to sustain, let alone Marvin Scrillio, and well, I guess, you know what Arieol, I do have some sympathy for him. I'll admit it. I do feel for him, at least in some ways, with all that pressure on him, this being his third film after he revolutionized the industry with his first adaptation of The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, and when his second film bombed after so many of those disasters all fell upon us, The Tempestuous Storm. Even I can admit, the failure of his second film wasn't his fault. Even I could see that.

I may be CEO, but I'm not a fucking animal.

I can absolutely feel for others!

I can even empathize with them!

However, I'm not planning on showing him that empathy, mind you.

Not if I'm going to get what I want.
