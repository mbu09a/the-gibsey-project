Not having anything else to do, and like so many others, even more depressed than the most tattered of souls, she's decided to take up writing fiction, mostly creating autobiographical sketches of herself-if that's even what they were exactly-or sketches of what she thought her cloned representative may be out there experiencing in the life-giving world outside of her resort-apartment, if she wasn't who she was, if she wasn't herself, is she wasn't her new Natalie and was the original version of herself. She's even managed to locate the bravery and motivation to email one of these sketches to her cloned representative self, who's supposed to be stopping by today to give her some feedback on what she'd written.

And she's curious what they'll say.

How accurate will it be?

Did it matter, ultimately, if it was or wasn't?

Or would it be more interesting to diverge from the reality being constructed around her doubled version of herself, to project something else, someone else, out there somewhere, in the landscapes of Gibsey World? Even if it was to be rejected?
