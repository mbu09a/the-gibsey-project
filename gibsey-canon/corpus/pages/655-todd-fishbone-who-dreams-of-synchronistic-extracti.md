Here, the tale gets interrupted by the Scherazade frame narrative, and then returns to the Shaykh to read yet another warning displayed in the tomb, "O thou who comest to this place, take warning by that which thou seest of the accidents of Time and the vicissitudes of Fortune and be not deluded by the world and its pomps and vanities and fallacies and falsehoods and vain allurements, for that it is flattering, deceitful and treacherous, and the things thereof are but a loan to us which it will borrow back from all borrowers. It is like unto the dreams of the dreamer and the sleep-visions of the sleeper or as the mirage of the desert, which the thirsty take for water."

Damn, that's intense as hell. Damn, and this is pertinent as hell too. Holy shit.

And this warning in the tomb continues and is essentially like, don't be like me. Learn from my example. I had everything, an army of thousands, and I said to them, I was like, "Ya'll gotta stop the coming doom or something," and they were like, "Woah! That's impossible. How are we to face the Lord of the door which has no doorkeeper?"

Huh? That's interesting? That reminds him of that recent episode he did on Janus? Very, very strange. And it's a good point, no doubt.

And the warnings continue, fate, death, entropy, the like, and the tomb is essentially saying, like, look, I hoarded all this wealth and it didn't do shit for me cause I was going to die anyway.

Good point, yep, that's a good point. He does remember that being a major theme.
