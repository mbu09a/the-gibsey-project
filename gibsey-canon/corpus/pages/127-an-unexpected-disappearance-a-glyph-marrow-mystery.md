And maybe the doctor was right. Maybe the ailments that don't affect us don't exist, and so if we want to feel better, to be happier, maybe it's about choosing how we're affected by things.

Here, because we're nearing the end. I'll go ahead and read the last part of the chapter. Maybe that'll clarify some of this. It's the section that precedes the cart moving through the Flooded Town section.

Oh! You're right we didn't get to discuss the whole conflict between Mark Davies and Tobi Backster, ah! I'll get to it in the next lecture, yes.

So the mine cart has been going through these pauses, these glitches you could say, throughout the narrative, there's this section I just find especially important to include.

Yes, I'm going to read it to you.

Yes.

Yes it's that section.

Oh, so this is a fairly iconic section you're saying? So some of you have heard of it even though you haven't even read the book?

Interesting, well I supposed that's why it stood out to me. Obviously, it's stood out to others before.

OK, so here we go. This is from Chapter 5.
