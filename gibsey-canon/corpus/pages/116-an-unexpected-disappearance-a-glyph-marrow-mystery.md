The isolation of the town that's devastated by the flood is similar to his own isolation. Oh, Rainbow Revene is supposed to be a ghost town, isn't it? Yes, that's a good point. There is a sense of emptiness often in the book, even early on, yes. That's a very good point, yes.

Well, tell me. What do you know about the flood which occurred to the town of Rainbow Revene? In the story of the ride, I mean.

Yes, yes. You're right, every version of the ride has a different natural disaster associated with it, Rainbow Revene being the flooded version of the story. Yes, but why was it flooded?

Hmmhmm, hmmhmm. Yes, that's right. They're each an allegory for the curse of colonialism, a sort of revenge tale, and this is the actual ride itself, not the ride of the novel. The natural disasters being the result of vengeful spirits are a part of every version of the ride, aren't they? Yes, you're right, and what does this have to do with Gibseyan Mysticism?

The magical element? Is that what you said?

Oh, the supernatural element.

Yes, yes. (Laughs)

Oh, it certainly does, yes.
