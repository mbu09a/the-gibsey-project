This was one of the things that had set Glyph apart.

He was a rather flawed, unfocused, and tangential soul, sure, but he was an expert at making connections.

Every painting was an image that could become a whole other image when seen from multiple angles, and all images displayed multiple images at once, and each of those images connected to other images, and all of these images were all also words which could be connected to other words and images and other words, and so on.

This was how Glyph saw the world.

Or how he'd seen it.

Stillman even sensed it within Glyph even early on, could sense the fire of Glyph's energy and it was a mental energy that was, well-

It was radiant.

It was brilliant.

Or it had been, at one time.
