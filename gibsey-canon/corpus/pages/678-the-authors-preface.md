**The Author's Preface**

And just like that, voices begin to accumulate.

There are too many to be heard at once, let alone named at once, and so The Author is forced to differentiate.

And this author, The Author, is an anomaly.

They're a novel form of creation, a creator, a clustering mass of rumors strung together with nothing but string, pencil shavings, and the prickly onset of doubts contemplated late into the night.

Many have come to believe that The Author's very existence could even be nothing but a series of interconnected rumors, that they could be manufactured entirely, and this is, in fact, quite possible.

But there are also other rumors-for those who are even concerned about such things--rumors that claim that definitive proof of The Author's unequivocal existence has been located, though the accuracy of these rumors, not being of universal interest, will not be explored here and will instead be touched on later by The Author's characters which they've chosen to populate their work, the work, the work of The Author, or the supposed work of The Author, since the nature of their work, along with their own given nature and actual existence has yet to be definitively proven, let alone identified.

But as the vice of rumor spreads from the power of its own self-creation, so do the problems that plague The Author's less-than-stable-to-say-the-least mental landscapes and daily processes.
