Now becoming a researcher of the underground, and evaluating an individual who has not yet been able to enter the surface, the current evaluator is especially unable to verify whether even Disney World itself is, truly, the contemporary corpus of the M.A.S.S. since this question does not pertain to their current research. It is entirely possible that Malt Gibsy World is instead the more accurate reality above the surface and that Walt Disney World is what exists underground. Whether this collective notion is correct, or whether the setting of The Wonderful World of Gibsey is the more accurate and real representation of the existence of life above ground regarding the mediated state of our world is an area of continual uncertainty which the current evaluator will have to determine and explore further in future analysis documents.
