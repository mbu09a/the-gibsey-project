Annotations included within the text are to be linked through hyperlinked extensions. Future Data and Information Researchers, Scientists, and Analysts can access these notes or annotations through clicking on the hyperlinks included within the text itself and are also welcome to add their own annotations which the current evaluator can both approve and disapprove of upon their completion.

Lastly, the current evaluator is at an absolute loss as to where the exact location of the setting within the document is meant to entirely exist. This is another aspect of the document that puts the work's fictive and realistic elements into question, as mentioned earlier. The current evaluator would assume, based on descriptions of the setting within the text, that the document's action takes place within Walt Disney World, the current corpus of the M.A.S.S. that is rumored to exist above the surface of the underground tunnels, but currently, this assertion, assumption, or inference, for the moment, is unverifiable. The setting, alternately, is described as existing within Malt Gibsy World, an alternative setting that seems to mirror that of the Walt Disney World complex. Why this choice was specifically made by The Author is currently unknown, but this choice will and should be parsed out within future Analysis Documents.
