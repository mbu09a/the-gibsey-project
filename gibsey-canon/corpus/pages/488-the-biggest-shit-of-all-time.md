**The Biggest Shit of All Time**

Is terror bona-fide terror if it's only partially perceived, glimpsed in the periphery rather than the center of the frame?

And if a man shits in the forest, are the trees the first to bristle at the gaseous odor or do they instead have to wait for its description to be stamped upon their surfaces in scarlet lettering?

Both options are a kind of forgetting, an unknowing, so the answer is neither, or both, which isn't an answer.

The fact is, there isn't always an answer.

Not always, but there are some answers, sometimes.

Sometimes, Jack Parlance gets lost, loses himself in these self-righteous loops of his where he thinks he's better than everybody else, which can often make him feel a little lonely, both out of guilt for feeling this way to begin with and out of the pure alienation of experiencing the feeling itself, which come to think of it, makes him feel a hell of a lot more than just a little bit lonely, truth be told. It can feel like the entire weight of existence is on his shoulders, and him alone. But then again, at other times, sometimes, he's able to notice this pattern, even the guilt, which allows him to correct himself, what his current therapist calls "self-monitoring," and come to think of it again, that word "monitoring" sounds an awful lot like surveillance, doesn't it? It's as if he's being made responsible for a fate which he cannot control.

But as long as you watch yourself doing it, you don't do anything wrong.
