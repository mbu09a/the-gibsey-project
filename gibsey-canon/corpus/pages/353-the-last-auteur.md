No, actually, you know what? I want that in the script. Find a way to get that in. It's essential. That's the movie right there. Oh, it may not be clear now, but you'll see. You'll see. I'm not sure you can tell me that I did anything wrong. I'm just like Gibsey and Moby Dick Arieol, the great populizer! I've made the specific general. Is it really so bad that I cut the budget? It had to be done. I want future audiences of this biographical film about me that you're writing, I want them to know this for sure. If anything, I think killing his myths, Scrillio's myths, destroying them outright, only for him to be the one to rebuild them, that's the sacred process that I repeat, and it's as Gibseyan as it could possibly be.
