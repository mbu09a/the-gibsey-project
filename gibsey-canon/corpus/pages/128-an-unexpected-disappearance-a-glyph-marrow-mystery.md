The cart has yet to fall. Nights have passed. Years, decades. Entire eons. And as such, Glyph has been transformed. Becoming the cart, and then the ride, and then the civilization. He has formed the land. The landscape. The blades of grass, swaying in the breeze, are each of his hair follicles. The tides are his blinking eyes. His breath stirs the winds across the prairies. He has invested the corpse of his body into an animation studio. He has become many. He has been incorporated into many things. He has been vertically disintegrating for all of known existence.

Gibsey started as an animation studio. But we've always animated more, so much more, than simple images. The cartoons were just our way of getting our foot in the door. We are an alien invasion. We aren't human. We never were. Don't forget that. We are not human. We are something else, something other.
