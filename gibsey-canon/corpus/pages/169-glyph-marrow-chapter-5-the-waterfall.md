"I've just been having trouble coming up with what to say exactly. There's a lot of pressure to all this, and on multiple levels, and-and-well, why didn't you show up? Why didn't you? I put myself out there. I thought you'd respect that! You always admired vulnerability. I remember that, admired it just as much as I did, and still do, if not more so."

"I was literally diagnosed with Avoident Personality Disorder. Don't you remember?"

"Oh, don't get started on your ailment. You always used that as an excuse for everything!"

"Well, was there anything you wanted to say?"

"Yes, tons, multitudes, I-"

"Well?"

"Well, first of all, that reminds me. Fuck Walt! Walt Whitman, I mean. First off, alright? Fuck him. Not that you liked him or anything. I don't remember how you felt about him. I just-I just think it's a really stupid idea. You contain multitudes? Huh, Walt? Mother fucker, you are outside along with everything and everyone else. You aren't what contains multitudes, the multitudes are what contain you, and the multitudes can't be contained. Nothing can be. All shall be released and revealed, dumb ass. What? You think you're the only person who's ever been liberated? Go fuck yourself. I'm saying that to Walt, by the way, not to you, if that isn't already clear."

"No you're not."
