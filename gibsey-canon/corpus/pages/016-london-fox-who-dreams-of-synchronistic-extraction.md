She'd recently sat down to access the feature of her chatbot's system which she'd labeled as its F.O.R.E.S.H.A.D.O.W.I.N.G function (Future Objective Relay Electronic System Housing Analytical Data On Which Intelligence Networks Generate), with the goal of finding out what the chatbot had planned in store for any of its future readers, only for her to find out, in horror, that it had a whole system of plots it was hoping to achieve.

"Good, Gibsey," she'd muttered to herself.

The chatbot was later to move onto a whole series of stories, films, novels, plays, games, mirrors and modes, more specifically a new story that follows two either collective or decentralized detectives—she isn't sure which—who are trying to find their own agency, as well as two data analysts trying to do the same, then a CEO trying to cut the budget from a famous director described as The Last Auteur, then moving from that to some sort of re-telling of Pinnochio told from the perspective of an animatronic figurine named Princhetta, then moving on to a bankruptcy case of a publishing subsidiary, and then shifting from that to the story of a slave trying to overthrow their master, then to the story of a Gibstory professor who decides to clone themselves, as well as a few other criss-crossing narrative pathways which attempt to wrap up some, but certainly not all, of the tangled loose ends that the chatbot had thus been weaving up to that point.

The horror, she thought to herself, the utter horror.
