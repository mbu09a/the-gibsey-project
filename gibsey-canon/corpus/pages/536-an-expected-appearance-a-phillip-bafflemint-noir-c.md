Philip Bafflemint is deeply, deeply confused.

But remembering that this slippage is occurring in public, he tries to set this all aside, turns left, and heads toward the cash register.

Judy had warned him that these slippages were only just about to begin, after all.

And what had she meant by that?

Was this already such a slippage?

And if so, was he the one that was slipping or was something being slipped into him?

Inside him?

How would he even be able to tell the difference?

Upon leaving the gas station, things would only get worse.

And worse and worse and worse.
