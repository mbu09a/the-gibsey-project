"Oren?"

Arieol interrupts their interrupting to interrupt their being interrupted.

"Can I use this story that you're telling me in something I'm thinking of working on?"

"Wait? You want to do what? The one about the desert?"

"Yes, I've started writing something of my own."

Something flashes in the eyes, in Oren's eyes.

Is it a hunger?

Cannibalism?

Was Arieol now to be eaten whole, alive, in medias res?

They picture this possibility so vividly it might as well have actually happened, picture Progresso snapping from the chair to throttle them to the ground, Oren's arm at Arieol's throat, pressing down, face going red, Oren licking his lips as he holds Arieol down.

Arieol twists in terror wunder their grasp, Oren's teeth, now radiant as light reflecting off a blade, are here to cut pieces from Arieol's face into bits like so many little pieces of vegetables scattered across so many cutting boards, and after all, isn't this the kind of thing the CEOs and all they represent are so often doing? Dismembering us, from both others, ourselves, and even themselves? Despite all the promises, there isn't even a commons anymore where anyone can socialize, let alone a place where someone could even go to just say "What's up" to their buddy. Everything had clattered away into a shuffling distance.

All we can hope for are spooky actions at a distance at this point.

It's getting so damn terrifying out there.

Surely, you have to have to have noticed it.

Almost cannibalistic even, and all without anonymity, at least except for the cannibals, of course.
