**The Last Auteur**

Cut!

Here is a director.

He wants to place you in the most creative, the most pleasurable, the most bang-for-your-buck, immersive bit of adapted vacational landscape in all the theme parks of Gibsey World, and this director, Marvin Scrillio, I'm standing on his set.

I'm watching him.

I'm fulfilling that myth of CEO as reader, standing there, watching him with a book under my arm, a novel, An Unexpected Disappearance, A Glyph Marrow Mystery, to be exact, and more about that specific text later.

I'm trying to act inconspicuous, not saying much, acting as if I'm not there, hoping to blend into the background, though there's nothing I can do, really, to be truly out of sight since my appearance is, on sets anyway, almost always noticed, if not expected. I'm the CEO of the whole damn thing, and not just of the company, mind you, but of the whole damn civilization, every part of it, big or small, above or below. All of it is mine to control and manipulate, not that I always achieve this control or manipulation, mind you, but I try. Gibsey World is my domain, so when I speak, when I poke my head in, when I give a nod or make my assessments, people perk up, artificial morale boosts, destructive behavior plummets, ass cheeks clench, and anxiety ensues. Even Scrillio, pompous ass that he is, director of this adaptation of the obscurely epical poetical novel he's renamed Wonderful Worlds has got to get his shit together because, when I'm on set, everyone notices. you have to notice, immediately.

It's like I'm magic.
