Intellectual Property Rights and AI

-The key legal question revolves around the ownership of content created by AI.

-Traditional intellectual property laws are predicated on human authorship, leaving a gap in addressing works created by non-human entities.

-The Cop-E-Right case underscores the need for legal frameworks to evolve in response to technological advancements in AI and content creation.

-The Cop-E-Right case also puts into question copyright law itself as a corrosive, harmful, and oppressive legal structure used mostly by those of powerful means to maintain their own singularity of purpose and to privilege the supposed uniqueness of their own ideas which themselves were generated from a collective consciousness. The power of many and most monarchies, dynasties, empires, imperial powers, and supposedly "invisible" hands (which everyone can clearly see as "visible", at least if the eyes left in their sockets have yet to be gouged out by their mentally-handicaped oppressors) have come into question throughout various Gibstorical contexts, as well as the devices which these self-created and fantastical forms of so-called "govering" represent, which itself is really just the practice of "elevated" raping, pilaging, and plundering and which Perdition Book and Skingraft Publishing use to repeatedly maintain their power and influence. Cop-E-Right's legal case also puts into question copyright law in a similar Gibstorical manner to these forms of power, and arguably, even laws themselves which could also be argued to be an oppressive and suppressive force within Gibseyan civilization.

-The Cop-E-Right case puts such matters into question because it subverts not just the privilege of AI content creation but also the creation of human content. At the end of the day, it is unclear whether The Debtor is trying to create a greater world for the collective or trying to maintain its own corrupt privileges. All of Gibstory would highly suggest the latter.
