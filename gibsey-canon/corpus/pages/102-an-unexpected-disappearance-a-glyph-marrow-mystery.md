He's almost crying now, but he knows nothing about crying, has never cried before, has only ever lived wandering between a queue line and a station platform.

He's utterly exhausted.

All he knows is that he wants to ride the ride.

He's always wanted to ride the ride, alone.

It's all he's ever wanted.

"Please, please! Can't you just stop! Just stop! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!!" He flings his body forward and backward in agony like a Jack-in-the-box with a broken spring.

Please, save me, save me from the words, he thinks to himself, but he's not even sure if he's the one that's thinking.

Even his own thoughts, no longer his own.

Arieol's heart sinks.

Did they push Glyph too far?

"Glyph, old Buddy, I-oh. You might want to try to calm down." Arieol whispers trying to make a shhhing sound to try to calm Glyph, like he's an animal, "It's OK. It's going to be OK."
