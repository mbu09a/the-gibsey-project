Being the collector that I am, like any avid tourist or Gibsey fanatic, I want to make an essential note.

By collecting the found material which I've strung together within this expansive volume, I have not intended to subvert or threaten the financial state, well-being, or status of the Walt Disney Company, in any way, shape, or form. The material collected within The Wonderful World of Gibsey is intended as a work of parody. Any references to such an entity, be it through figurative or very sparing literal means, are not intended as subversive acts of any kind, nor are they intended as a breach of copyright regarding any of Disney's properties or characters. They are instead meant to artfully capture, in a literary manner, the parodically absurd reality of the world in which we live, a world which includes and often interacts with Walt Disney World and its various characters and properties.
