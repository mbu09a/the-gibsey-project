The current evaluator mentions this detail of life within the underground complexes within this report before continuing their analysis of the text in question because it may become an important factor, as well as a possible subjective bias within the work of their continued analysis of the text in question. The M.A.S.S/ and A.D.D. do not entirely discourage personal biases of this kind to be included in Analysis documentation as long as they are documented and self-consciously addressed within Daily A.D.D. Yearly Analysis Reports, such as this one.

Our field is dominated by data, our economy, society, and the underground tunnels where many of us live are monitored and ruled over by data. Because of this, keeping relevant and consistent documentation reigns supreme. As long as subjective experiences are documented, they can remain, at least in part, justified. The data of our world, and its infinite, collective benefits, will eventually save and redeem us all. This document is merely one of an endless part of that circular, endless, and monumental process.
