"Sir, you need to fasten your seat belt," A cast member interrupts.

Shamrock Stilman is frozen in place.

"Sir?"

"Oh, sorry, thank you."

"No problem."

"So you're a close friend of Glyph Marrow's though, huh? Good guy, that one. A little loopy, sure, but dependable. And here we are. Shamrock Stillman, in the flesh. Funny, you're heavier than I pictured you being. Nice beard though. Did you always have it or has that just been ever since the disappearance? Hello! Anybody there? Why does everybody suddenly get so tight lipped around me all the time! I'm not some sort of ADD agent or something, am I? Actually, wait, ha, I forgot! I am! Probably doesn't speak too well to my analytical skills though, huh? Though maybe it was all just a metaphor the whole time, anyway. ADD does sound like an awfully suspicious name? And intelligence is an awfully strange word, as well. Half the time I hear it, it sounds positively divine, like Gibsey or something. Wouldn't angels then be intelligence agents? Oh! What a thought! Funny how we used to fear Gibsey and now it's those sorts of networks, huh? But fear not. Be not afraid. It's all just a big charade. Do you believe in Gibsey by the way? Oh, what an absurd question, right! Who would believe in a fictional construct? Or maybe those are the things worth believing in most? Make the impossible possible, right? No shit, Shamrock. You might want to speak up and stat! Cause once we get this baby going, we're skipping straight to the end."
