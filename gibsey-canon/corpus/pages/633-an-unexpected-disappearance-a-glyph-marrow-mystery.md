"Who are you?" Stillman chirps up, flabbergasted.

"Name's Arieol, by the way, Arieol Owlist. Either we haven't met before, we have, or you don't remember me. Either way, it's good to meet you, good to meet you again, or to see you again. And my Gibsey, The Author's supposed to be so obsessed with the new, but they sure are repetitous aren't they? I guess they're like Gibsey in that way."

"How did you know Glyph?"

"Well, we met once. You could say we rode a ride together, in a way. I'm not exactly sure when, where, how, or what dimension it occurred in, but it definitely occurred. I'm kinda in your boat where I'm not even sure whether I dreamed it all up or not, but it's not like that even matters. No separation, remember? Or wait? Did I say that to you or Glyph? There I go, again, mixing the subject and the object."

"Is he alive?"

"Well, that's a metaphysical question, isn't it? If you mean do I know what's happened to him? I certainly do not! Ambiguity of meaning is in right now, so I can't really say. Plus, don't forget. If you knew for sure, you'd let it go, wouldn't you? Why not embrace the lack and let it go on forever? That's the only thing we have isn't it? Time? In all its infinite limits. Ain't that just like us though? Makin' a heaven out of hell and a hell out of heaven. Excess. Too much of a good thing. Can't say I don't relate."
