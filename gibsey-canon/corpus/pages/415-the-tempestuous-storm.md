She doesn't realize that something important is going on.

Not at all.

She instead sits alone, waiting.

And nothing happens.

No one shows up in the lecture hall.

The seats are blank and empty.

What the hell is going on?

She checks her email.

And then she notices.

Tornado warning.

Oh, no.

Another tempestuous storm?

Another problem?

Always with these repeated externalities happening all around her.

They've been happening so often lately, haven't they?

Her course has been relocated to a Gibsey World Great Oak Lodge University office space which has been allocated to the select few classes, such as hers, requiring such relocation.

And she only has 22 minutes to get there.

And without tenure, she pretty much has to make an appearance, an attempt must be made and maintained.

But there's no way she's getting there in 22 minutes.

Though maybe she can try anyway?
