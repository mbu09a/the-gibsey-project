They don't remember the silence of the room at the end of the day when they'd stared out at the large screen-like surface of the window, down at the highway below them-highways being an important image in The Author's work since highways contain so much-the speed, the spread of the highways, scrolling, the ubiquity of transportation systems, as well as Gibsey's obsession with trains, the impetus of Gibseyland coming to their mind, meaning to Gibsey, iconically and ironically while watching the orbital loop of a train set, or was it a carrossel?

They don't remember the similarities between carousels and railroads, the similarities between wheels and control systems, all of these being different forms of technology and power. They don't remember that they're standing in The Main Square Cinema U.S.A in the early morning at one of the park's first areas near the Entrance Way of Gibsey World's premiere landscape, The Magical Dominion. They don't remember the clean, dry touch of the paper they'll hold against their fingertips, the manuscript, once they've finished it all, which they've held, or will hold, within their shaking hands, when it's all over, after it's all, finally, over.

They don't remember that nothing is coming back onto the screens because they're blank, black, and empty, which makes no sense, whatsoever, because this is Gibsey World, after all, and in Gibsey World, nothing is ever blank, black, or empty, nothing is ever turned off, the lights are always on, forever, infinitely, terrifyingly always, horribly ON.

They don't remember because they aren't present.

They often aren't present.

Who can be within this state of things?
