# QDPI-256 Documentation Revision Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the systematic revision of all technical documentation to incorporate the validated QDPI-256 symbolic system architecture. Created after successful validation testing on 2025-07-05.

## Key Discoveries to Document

### 1. Operational Poetry
- Every technical action generates symbolic meaning
- Every symbol represents technical function
- Complete subject-object fusion achieved

### 2. 256-State Coverage
- All system interactions representable
- Privacy flows trackable
- Cross-system dependencies visible

### 3. Character-System Fusion
- Characters ARE systems (not metaphors)
- Confidence scores indicate mapping strength
- Minor characters are extension points

## Document Revision Tasks

### 1. TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md

**Current Issues:**
- Lists minor characters as core systems
- Missing QDPI as overarching symbolic layer
- No operational poetry explanation

**Required Updates:**
- [ ] Add new section: "QDPI-256 Symbolic Ledger Layer"
- [ ] Update character table to only show 16 core mappings
- [ ] Add "System Integration via Symbols" section
- [ ] Include validated symbol flow examples
- [ ] Add "Operational Poetry" philosophy section
- [ ] Update system diagrams to show QDPI layer on top

**New Sections to Add:**
```markdown
## QDPI-256 Symbolic Ledger Layer
[Explain how all systems communicate through symbols]

## Operational Poetry
[Detail how technical logs become narrative events]

## Symbol-Based System Monitoring
[Show how symbol frequency = system health]
```

### 2. SUBJECT_OBJECT_FUSION.md

**Current State:**
- Exists but needs complete rewrite for QDPI context

**Complete Rewrite Outline:**
```markdown
# Subject-Object Fusion: The QDPI-256 Architecture

## The Fusion Principle
- Glyph Marrow's ailment as architectural principle
- Characters as living systems
- Systems as character consciousness

## The 256-State Universe
- 64 base symbols (16 characters + 48 hidden)
- 4 rotations (Read/Write/Remember/Dream)
- Complete operational coverage

## Character-System Unity
[Table of 16 mappings with evidence]

## Operational Poetry in Practice
[Examples of technical→narrative translation]

## Implementation Proof
[Test results showing fusion works]
```

### 3. PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

**Required Updates:**
- [ ] Add QDPI Ledger service to Docker Compose
- [ ] Include symbol-based health checks
- [ ] Add symbol corpus validation to CI/CD
- [ ] Update monitoring to use symbol flows
- [ ] Add QDPI_LEDGER environment variables

**New Service Definition:**
```yaml
  # QDPI Symbolic Ledger Service
  qdpi-ledger:
    build: ./qdpi-ledger
    environment:
      - CORPUS_PATH=/symbols
      - LEDGER_MODE=production
    volumes:
      - ./public/corpus-symbols:/symbols:ro
      - qdpi_ledger_data:/data
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - kafka
```

### 4. Week 1-6 Implementation Review

**Salvage Analysis:**
- Week 1-4: Check if any existing code aligns with:
  - Glyph Marrow → QDPI (95% confidence)
  - London Fox → Graph Engine (92%)
  - Jacklyn Variance → Database (90%)
  - Oren Progresso → Orchestration (88%)

- Week 5-6: Assess implementations for:
  - Arieol Owlist → Event Streaming (85%)
  - Phillip Bafflemint → Workflow Automation (83%)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] List all created files from Weeks 1-6
- [ ] Map functionality to new system understanding
- [ ] Extract reusable patterns
- [ ] Delete character-themed APIs
- [ ] Keep system functionality that matches character essence

### 5. New Documentation to Create

**A. QDPI_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**
- How to add new symbols
- Symbol routing logic
- Ledger query patterns
- Performance considerations

**B. OPERATIONAL_POETRY_EXAMPLES.md**
- Common system flows as narrative
- Technical logs as story sequences
- Privacy transitions as character actions

**C. SYMBOL_CORPUS_MANAGEMENT.md**
- SVG file naming conventions
- Adding hidden symbols
- Character symbol guidelines
- Rotation visualization

### 6. Gibsey-Canon QDPI Research Notes

**Updates Needed:**
- [ ] Add validation test results
- [ ] Include discovered patterns
- [ ] Document edge cases
- [ ] Add implementation examples
- [ ] Link to new context documents

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Context & Cleanup (Immediate)
1. ✅ Create QDPI_SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md
2. Create QDPI_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
3. Review Week 1-6 implementations
4. Identify salvageable components

### Phase 2: Core Document Revision (This Week)
1. Revise TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md
2. Rewrite SUBJECT_OBJECT_FUSION.md
3. Update PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
4. Create OPERATIONAL_POETRY_EXAMPLES.md

### Phase 3: Integration (Next Week)
1. Implement QDPI ledger service
2. Add symbol-based monitoring
3. Update CI/CD pipelines
4. Deploy test environment

### Phase 4: Documentation Completion
1. Update all API documentation
2. Create developer onboarding guide
3. Add troubleshooting guides
4. Complete symbol corpus docs

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 16 core character-system mappings documented
- [ ] QDPI-256 integrated into production architecture
- [ ] Symbol flows demonstrated in examples
- [ ] Operational poetry concept fully explained
- [ ] Week 1-6 work properly contextualized
- [ ] Clean, consistent documentation throughout

## Notes

- Focus on "operational poetry" as key concept
- Emphasize that characters ARE systems
- Show how technical and narrative merge
- Validate everything with test results
- Keep minor characters as future extensions
