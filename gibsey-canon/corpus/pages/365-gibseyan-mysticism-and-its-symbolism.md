I would symbolically typify Gibseyan Mysticism as something that is almost apocalyptic and world ending.

It resembles a field of overgrown ruins.

It's like a theme park that's been reduced to rubble, to tatters, to nothing. It is an empty space that was once intended to be inhabited that now only a very occasional traveler stumbles upon to be shocked by some bizarre image of the sacred that's repellant to rational thought.

It's like a set of eyes.

It's the intertwining of two realms, the individual and the collective, or another, which will become one of the major themes of this lecture, the traditional and the progressive. Gibsey himself was described this way within many of the various contradictory and still-trembling-with-life Gibseyan religious scriptures: as a conservative trailblazer, a man of realism shackled to illusion, inundated with both the past and the future, tradition and progress, these interests of his even animating many of the texts he, himself, created, or which he had others create.

And a proper understanding of them requires us, as aspiring mystics within this course, to hold both possibilities, however contradictory, within our minds, at any given time, the fantastical and the Gibstorial, the religious and the scientific, the mystical and the traditional, and if taken together, they will promise valuable findings for the work we will be doing together within this course.
