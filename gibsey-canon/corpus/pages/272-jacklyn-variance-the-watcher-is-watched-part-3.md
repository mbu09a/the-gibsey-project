The document titled Jack Parlance Who Misses His Family included in the previous Daily Yearly Document Report relates to a number of repeated features found within many sections of the The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey documents, one feature of which that's important to consider regarding its possible subversive elements, is the repeated use of creative individuals stuck in a process of unfinished and endless development. This narrative structure symbolizes a material reality within the theme park of our civilization, one material example of which is the growing ubiquity of continued training and education within the MASS markets (the Media Analysis State Services departments), a technique now used ubiquitously within agencies like ADD, if not especially within these sorts of agencies.

One no longer reaches a place of stasis, a place where one can rest, a vacation without end where one can be finished, or where one's work is finally complete. Instead, what is commonly referred to as a "growth mindset" has been infused into the corporate parlance of most agencies.
