But all the while, there were the images, the words.

They never left him.

They haunted.

Where was Glyph Marrow?

Around lunchtime, he calls Glyph again without an answer and wonders what he can do to search for one.

By 3pm, he's sweating through his shirt, and by 4pm, vertigo is setting in, causing him to stumble in those same zig-zag patterns from the night before, but this time without the frivolity of scotch.

Was he cursed?

He feels so haunted.

He sometimes has to stay as late as 6 or 7, but he leaves early today, stopping home to get a quick change of clothes before heading for the park.

There was nothing natural about what he's seen, or funny, or even sad.

There are no words to describe it.
