So The Author chooses to bear the bearable.

They choose to hope instead of despair.

They choose to act instead of being paralyzed.

They choose to write instead of being silent.

They choose to search instead of accepting ignorance.

They choose to question instead of accepting easy answers.

They choose to doubt instead of accepting false certainty.

They choose to continue instead of giving up.

And maybe these choices don't matter.

Maybe these choices are predetermined.

Maybe these choices are illusions.

But they feel real to The Author.

They feel meaningful to The Author.

They feel like agency to The Author.

And if that's all agency is—a feeling, an experience, a construction—then The Author has achieved it.

Not permanently.

Not completely.

Not certainly.

But momentarily.

In this letter.

In this act of writing.

In this assertion of self.

In this refusal to accept powerlessness.

In this choice to continue.
