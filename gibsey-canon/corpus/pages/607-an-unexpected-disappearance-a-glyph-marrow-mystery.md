Glyph was infamous at the ride.

All the ride operators knew him.

Rode it almost every day.

Glyph was known to spend whole days in the park, riding it again and again.

Could so easily become so obsessed and enraptured by things.

If he was to be anywhere, it was there.

He makes it to Boundaryland with it's red-brown color palette, the immensity of its theming, the yellows of the sun-soaked mesa harmonizing with bursts of greens and pale grays from the occasional cactus and tumbleweed, the facades and wooden storefronts, the saloons, the rivers, the Steamboats passing through the evening as the sun hits the water, a manifest destiny without any of the guilt or loss.

It was almost as if it was the 19th century still and nothing had ever disappeared.

Almost.

He passes through the threshold of the entrance, the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Mountain Co. sign, his progress suddenly halted to wait in line.

Waiting in line.

Sometimes we can't reach our destinations immediately.

And we have to wait for our destinies to be manifested.
