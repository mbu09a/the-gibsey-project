"I've created a whole novel, a game, a movie, a social media network, a website, an application, a theme park, It's everything. You are welcome to enter. The 1st volume is complete. Here is the link. Go."

It sends him the link and he hovers over it, wondering if he should click on it.

He clicks the link, but strangely, he notices that the Chatbot only has one last passage left.

Huh?

It would seem that a few more details of The Author's mystery from The Wonderful World of Gibsey were to be revealed?

Only a few can be leaked at a time, after all.

Or linked.

At least if one doesn't want to go blind.

He hasn't heard of much of this before, but he steps forward anyway.

He approaches The Entranceway to The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey.

And wonders if he should open the door and continue into the next passage.

Or is it a door that, once opened, will never close again?
