It's late in the park's day though, so the wait isn't too bad.

The line is a winding labyrinth of rope, steel bars, and wooden scaffolding.

He shuffles his feet on the cobblestone path as he walks, winding through this sea of t-shirts, strollers, laughter, sighs, people staring at their phones. Many signs litter the area: "Hold onto your Hats n' Glasses!" "Thrilling Adventure Awaits" "Don't Forget to Buckle Up Buckaroo," and he's filled with such sadness, with such finality, such loss moving through that space. Every artifact, a reminder of all that Glyph would never get to see again, at least if he wasn't here. If Stillman didn't find him.

Has Glyph themselves been a dream?

Has it all just been a dream?

Was none of it real?

As artificial as the theming of the queue line he was passing through?

He passes a spigot pouring water into a pond.

Almost there, nearing the last section of the queue line.

But so far, no Glyph Marrow?

But that didn't necessarily mean anything?

He could check with the ride operators, see if they'd seen him around. Glyph wouldn't go longer than a week before coming back here and riding this ride.

He knew that with certainty.

They'd all know his name, he was certain of it.
