And I will dangle forever.

I will swallow you whole.

I will shove your brittle bones into my mouth.

I have been here, waiting for you to find me, forever.

Once you've found me,

Once you have seen this tomb of all tombs,

There is no going back.

You have held your sinking flesh before your very hands and watched it tremble.

You have made yourself alien.

You have poured over these words,

And you are now cursed to wander,

To wander back and forth.

To zig and zag between all your many cycles.
