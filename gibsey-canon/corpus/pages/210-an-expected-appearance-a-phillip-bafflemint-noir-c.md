"But last episode," the narrator continues, "Princhetta started figuring out a way to sneak out onto the balcony. What do you think of that?"

Clips from the previous episode of Princhetta sneaking out of her in-park resort room, alone, are shown. She certainly appears human. There's a shiftiness to her movements here and there, but for an animatronic figure, Phillip can admit, she looks incredibly life-like. He could only barely tell the difference, and even then, he wondered if he could only even perceive such a difference because he'd been told there was one?

Huh?

He wonders if this was a rerun, or if it was a new episode entirely?

The ring tone on his smart phone goes off with a suddenness which causes him to somehow knock over his TV dinner onto the carpet-and he's usually not the clumsy-type-wait, no, he jerks so violently, he knocks over the whole damn TV tray table, not just the plastic tray of food, and without any consideration as to the chaotic stains that such slippages would then enact upon his otherwise unstained carpet.

Very out of character there, Mr. Bafflemint.
