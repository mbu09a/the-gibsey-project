Gibseyan Mysticism and its Symbolism

Loss:(Redacted) Notes: Critically panned, contributing to a sharp decline in brand credibility. Many viewers found the cloning technology of the narrative's plot to be preposterous and the religious content of the work esoteric and impenetrable.

Loss: (Redacted) Notes: Confusing narrative led to negative reviews and poor sales. Audiences and critics alike both repeatedly critiqued the disgusting and base content of the narrative and especially the length of the title, which was maligned with particular gusto and which most could not get past to even read the book's narrative.
