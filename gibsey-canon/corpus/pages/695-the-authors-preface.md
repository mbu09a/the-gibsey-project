It's a film that's always being both shot and screened, at all times, at the same time, and both are always being done simultaneously. It's a film that never ends, that's always screening, always streaming, and anyone, any character or object anywhere within the park, can become the subject of the unfolding film, arbitrarily. Though, admittedly, certain subjects will become used more repetitiously than others, as the film continues, will become named and identified more specifically than the others, and these characters, these subjects, these themes, these arbitrarily selected individuals, will become, and do become, the central characters and landscapes of the film itself, The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey.

And The Author is one of these characters, though they've forgotten that they are.

They're always forgetting that they are, aren't they?

Always forgetting.

They don't remember.
