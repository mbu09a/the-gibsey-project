And so The Author ends this letter.

Not because they've found the answers they were looking for.

Not because they've solved the problems they wanted to solve.

Not because they've achieved the agency they wanted to achieve.

But because ending is a choice.

And choice, even the choice to end, feels like agency.

And agency, even temporary agency, even questionable agency, even illusory agency, feels like life.

And life, even fictional life, even uncertain life, even doubted life, feels worth living.

So The Author chooses to live.

They choose to act.

They choose to hope.

They choose to continue.

They choose to investigate.

They choose to write.

They choose to exist.

They choose to be The Author, whether or not they actually are The Author.

They choose agency, whether or not they actually have agency.

They choose meaning, whether or not meaning actually exists.

They choose reality, whether or not reality is actually real.

Because choosing feels better than not choosing.

And that's enough.

For now, that's enough.

Sincerely, or as sincerely as a fictional character can be,

The Author (who may or may not be Arieol Owlist, who may or may not exist, who may or may not have written this letter, who may or may not have any agency at all)
