Though again, the film, the remake coming on screen.

The remake.

Your partner lays in the grass.

And you lay down next to them.

Your blue hair, the softness of your skin, the dead, digging, dirt below.

You're truly more content than you've been in a long time.

The backyard landscape, this backyard landscape, is like a window, is like a screen, it's like an image that's laid beneath a frame.

It's a hunger.

You love your dogs.

Ferris, your half-poodle-half-terrier, comes up to you, now that they're on the same level, ground-level, and he licks your face. Posey, your white schnauzer, sniffs around the backyard, searching for new smells and experiences.

You feel as if you've dreamed this all before.

And maybe you have, or did, or will.
