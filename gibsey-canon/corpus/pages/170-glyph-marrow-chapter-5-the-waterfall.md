"You were saying that to yourself."

"I--I--" The Author pauses, considering pointing their finger and waving it at them, "What do you mean by that?"

"You were saying it to yourself."

"Wait a second. Wait JUST a fucking second. What do you mean by that? Tell me.What exactly do you mean? How far should I read into what it is you're saying to me? Do tell. You come all this way, crossing time and space and eons, it's not the x or y axis, it's the z axis or some shit, the whole power of love bit, and all you have to say is that I've been monologuing to myself this whole time? That it was just me? I was just saying it to myself? That's it? That's what you came here to tell me?"

"The first time, I didn't show up, I'll remind you. You did this to yourself."

"I did it to myself. That's always the fucking answer to everything. What are you a fucking neolib now? Personal responsibility, huh? What have they done to you!"

"You could have let me go."

"What?"

"That's what I was trying to tell you. That's why I didn't show up."

They pause, a bit shocked.
