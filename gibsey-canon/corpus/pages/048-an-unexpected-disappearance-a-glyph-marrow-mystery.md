Here for an eternity, another festival, returning, dangling rocks, the envious spokes.

And none of this even conveys what the image of this walk was like for me.

And it can't.

The words mask the images, and the images mask the words, and why does either even matter?

I'm not even going to be able to ride the ride without someone to ride it with me.

No one's operating it. No one's—

The peaks, monument valley, monuments here to commemorate the nostalgia of meaning, of mining?

Nostalgia for what?

The past?

Monument valley?

Horrific, ceaseless violence?

Mining.

Dust and sweat, heavy breathing.

Your last breath stolen from you from the burning throb of the bullet wound snaking its way through your insides. You pray that the pain lifts you from this place, but it doesn't. You stay there, vacant, to bleed out, knowing that all you'd fought for was a failure, that they'd paint over you entirely, commemorate your memory with the green statue of a cart's wooden scaffolding. You spit blood as you lay face down on the cold, green earth, a graying, golden earth, the image turning more and more gray until the gray bleeds to black—and it doesn't even fade—shivering within your body, outside of your body.
