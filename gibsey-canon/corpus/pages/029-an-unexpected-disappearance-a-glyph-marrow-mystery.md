But when the doctor you've visited doesn't believe you have an ailment which you know for a fact you have, it's always very difficult to fully grasp the exact nature of your ailment.

That's an additional part of my ailment, the fact that I'm not even sure it exists.

In this way, my ailment has many different parts to it, different layers. It's like a wedding cake that's stacked on top of another wedding cake, or like time and reality arranged on top of one another, in columns and rows.

I first noticed the words while taking my daily walk, zig-zagging through the maze of the line, observing and re-observing the miniature stories which the Imaginators arranged throughout the queue line, all those details designed to entertain the guests who would walk through and wait for the ride to begin.

I don't live in the park itself. I don't remember if I've mentioned that, have I? I live in an uninhabited reconstruction of the park. There's hundreds of them that exist now, now that Gibsey World's subsumed the known world, maybe even thousands of them, all continuously under development, or de-development, or even re-development. Surely one day there'll be millions of them, and even more than that, on into infinity. Vacations without end. And this was what Gibsey had once promised us, after all, hadn't he? That Gibsey World would live forever. That it would never die. And yet it feels so empty living here, walking through the queue line alone, back and forth and back and forth, through the labyrinthian metal railings, passing the paint that's starting to peel.
