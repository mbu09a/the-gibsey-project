# QDPI-256 System Context & Clarifications

## Overview
This document clarifies the core QDPI-256 symbolic system architecture after validation testing on 2025-07-05. It establishes the canonical character-to-system mappings and explains edge cases discovered during implementation.

## Core Principles

### The 256-State Universe
- **64 Base Symbols**: 16 character symbols + 48 hidden symbols
- **4 Rotations**: Read (public→public), Write (private→private), Remember (private→public), Dream (AI generation)
- **Total States**: 64 × 4 = 256 unique symbolic states
- **Complete Coverage**: Every system action maps to a symbol+rotation

## Validated Core Character-System Mappings

| Character | System | Confidence | Evidence | Symbol IDs |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------|------------|
| **Glyph Marrow** | QDPI Protocol | 95% | "Perception ≡ Language" | 8-11 |
| **London Fox** | Graph & Relationship Engine | 92% | Creates consciousness mapping AI | 4-7 |
| **Jacklyn Variance** | Core Database & API Gateway | 90% | D.A.D.D.Y.S-H.A.R.D reports | 24-27 |
| **Oren Progresso** | Orchestration & Observability | 88% | "CEO of whole civilization" | 28-31 |
| **Princhetta** | Modular AI Orchestration | 87% | "Brains are like amusement parks" | 36-39 |
| **Arieol Owlist** | Event Streaming & Processing | 85% | "Time is a slider, not arrow" | 48-51 |
| **Phillip Bafflemint** | Workflow Automation & Rituals | 83% | "Order is survival ritual" | 12-15 |
| **Shamrock Stillman** | Security, CDN & Global Access | 82% | Director of A.D.D. | 56-59 |
| **an author** | User & Auth Management | 75% | Foundational identity layer | 0-3 |
| **Jack Parlance** | Real-Time Communication | 72% | Recursive communication | 52-55 |
| **Old Natalie Weissman** | Semantic Search & Indexing | 70% | Knowledge keeper role | 32-35 |
| **New Natalie Weissman** | In-Memory & Real-Time Data | 68% | Clone dynamics/caching | 44-47 |
| **Cop-E-Right** | Local AI/LLM Hosting | 65% | Self-hosting entity | 40-43 |
| **The Author** | Peer-to-Peer & Decentralized | 62% | Distributed identity | 60-63 |
| **Manny Valentinas** | Knowledge Base & Documentation | 50% | *Needs stronger evidence* | 16-19 |
| **[Unassigned]** | Natural Language Understanding | - | *Needs character assignment* | 20-23 |

## Character Clarifications

### Core vs. Minor Characters
- **Core 16**: Only the characters listed above are part of the primary QDPI-256 system
- **Minor Characters**: Section-based profiles like Judy S. Cargot, Todd Fishbone are NOT core mappings
- **AI Artifacts**: Some character references are context expansion from AI assistants
- **Future Extensions**: Minor characters reserved as extension points for system growth

### Symbol File Naming
- **Character Symbols**: `an_author.svg`, `london_fox.svg`, etc.
- **Hidden Symbols**: `hidden_symbol_01.svg` through `hidden_symbol_48.svg`
- **Case Variations**: System handles `cop-e-right.svg` vs `cop_e_right` automatically
- **Missing Files**: `judy_s_cargot.svg` and case-sensitive `the_author.svg` are not errors

## Operational Poetry

Every technical action in the system generates a symbolic sequence that can be read as both:
1. **Technical Log**: System A → System B with privacy transition
2. **Narrative Event**: Character performs action with emotional/symbolic meaning

Example:
```
Technical: USER_AUTH(READ) → SECURITY(WRITE) → DATABASE(REMEMBER)
Narrative: an_author seeks entry → shamrock validates in private → jacklyn archives the moment
```

## Validation Results

### Test Coverage (2025-07-05)
- ✅ All 256 symbol IDs correctly mapped (0-255)
- ✅ System flow tracking validated
- ✅ Privacy transitions captured
- ✅ Cross-system dependencies mapped
- ✅ 62/64 base symbols found (2 are valid exclusions)

### System Integration Patterns
```
Auth Flow: USER_AUTH → SECURITY_CDN → CORE_DATABASE
AI Pipeline: QDPI → AI_ORCHESTRATION → LOCAL_AI → GRAPH_ENGINE  
Event Flow: EVENT_STREAMING → WORKFLOW → REAL_TIME_DATA → ORCHESTRATION
```

## Implementation Notes

### Symbol ID Calculation
```python
symbol_id = (base_symbol_index * 4) + rotation_value
# Where rotation_value: READ=0, WRITE=1, REMEMBER=2, DREAM=3
```

### System Load Monitoring
Symbol frequency in ledger = System load indicator

### Privacy Auditing
Rotation transitions show data privacy flow:
- READ→WRITE = Public consumed privately
- WRITE→REMEMBER = Private data archived
- REMEMBER→DREAM = Archive used for AI generation
- DREAM→READ = AI output made public

## Next Steps
1. Update all architecture documents with these mappings
2. Remove references to minor characters from core system docs
3. Implement QDPI ledger in production infrastructure
4. Create system monitoring dashboards based on symbol flows
