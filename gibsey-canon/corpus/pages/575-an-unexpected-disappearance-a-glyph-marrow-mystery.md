And was that the reason he was so sad?

Was it even sadness?

Where was it all coming from?

He stares as fragments of orange light starting to ease up around the edges of the horizon.

He's been drinking nearly all night, hasn't he?

Has it all just been a conversation with Glyph, just one of those more spooky-actions-at-a-distance type varieties?

Was Glyph out there on some patio or balcony of his own thinking about him?

Down to the ice again, the melting ice.

Water drips off him as he heaves himself from the hot tub, practically sloshing his way to the sliding glass door.
