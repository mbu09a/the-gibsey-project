Within the backyard of his parent's home, where their parents still live, there is a landscape where they often go within their dreams, their backyard.

Their father sets up a tent to camp out in, all for play, temporarily, for the evening, in the backyard. They grip a partially translucent flashlight with bigger batteries than they've ever seen, and they notice that the batteries clunk against each end like an empty rainstick.

Their father tells them improvised ghost stories under lamplight, grimacing, the light of the stars above too intimidated, too overwhelmed by the city's ever-expanding constellations.

So many lights, like so many names- a common problem in amateur writing.

Constellations.

They sleep on an itchy cot and listen to the mantra-like-hum of the cicadas pulsing in the neighborhood, moving in and out of sleep, the sound of their father's grunting snores, probably not the best sound to be broadcasting to the neighborhood, the cot crunching against polyurethane as they turn over in the night. The next morning, they peacefully come awake into the mid morning heat, early sunlight peeking in through the tent's clear plastic. They wake up, sweaty, on a cot in the Texas heat, for no reason other than to play a game in the backyard.

To play a game in a backyard.

And they loved it.

They loved playing this game.

They wanted to do it again.

For months, they asked and asked if they could do it again, and they were always told they would, but they never did. They never did it a second time, at least not that they can remember.

They don't remember.

They don't remember.

They don't.
