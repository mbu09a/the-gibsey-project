In such a state of things, as is often asked, was any anonymity even possible any longer?

Of course it isn't.

Parlance is being described before our very eyes, and surely you'll be next.

Or if anonymity is to be achieved, maybe it has to be created, projected, written into existence, which Jack Parlance realizes, or has realized, or will eventually realize at a later date, reasons among many as to why he's clattering away at it all like he is in total anonymity without a soul in sight to read even a single scrap.

Not that he knows of, at least.

Parlance at the Bench.

He imagines himself in different scenes, scenarios, episodes.

Jack Parlance does, with Arieol watching.

The first is a birthday party.

Paper hat, confetti, whistles being blown.

The whole thing's fashioned around, stylized around, a homage to the Pee Ter Pantanomicon ride, you know the one with the excessively long wait times- and finally, we're getting to something from the parks, I knew it would eventually happen!-the one where the riders glide in that flying ship over a series of images like an alien abduction.
