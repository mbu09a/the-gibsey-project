Shamrock Stillman comes awake into a harrowing mass.

Screaming.

He is in his bedroom in his Hawaiian Oasis Bungalow, the sheets twisted and coated in sweat.

He's had such vivid dreams, such visions.

Strange nightmares have recently befallen him.

The kind that stick around, not ready to return to the places from which they've come, but he'd greatly prefer it if they did.

He's dreamt about Glyph Marrow, and Arieol Owlist, and a Flooded Town, and a Monument to Thunder, and a dead God.

Either that, or a dead Gibsey.

What was happening?

Something was being done to him.

He could feel it.

But he tries to ignore it and go about his day naturally.

Like nothing has happened.

Cup of coffee.

Tooth brush.

Takes his car to the office.

Attends meetings.

Holds a few conferences.

Makes a few phone calls.

Follows leads.

What else can you do?
