I'm typically still lost, still staring at the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Co. sign by this point, trying to figure out what such a title even means, or I'm staring at the sign's faded, rustic lettering. Either way, whenever I find myself losing myself staring at objects within moments such as these, I typically snap myself back into wakefulness and continue with my walk. I saunter on through the line, the weight of my ailment not quite hitting me just yet, the objects and the words, their boundaries still vivid and distinct from one other. I step forward through the railways of stone and granite, the handrails before me, and I pass the rusted cans, the scattered wagon wheels, the dotted brushes of cacti and shrubbery, the lanterns, all of them giving this crafted environment a weight and direction, a forward momentum, of moving in line, of waiting, of waiting, of waiting in line, of moving forward, forever forward, again.
