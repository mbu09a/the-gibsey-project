But he had to admit, as the process unfolded, he felt as if he was a missing puzzle piece that had found the exact puzzle that was ready to house him already pre-formed and waiting for him to snap into place like a prodigal son returned. He felt like a slice of bread smothered with peanut butter that looks across a cafe to see the starry eyes of another slice of bread slathered with jelly, and they're giving him one of those you-know-I'd-fuck-you-now-if-it-was-socially-acceptable-but-obviously-we-can't-just-start-doin-it-in-public-so-oh-just-you-wait-until-I-get-you-back-to-my-apartment-you-sick-sick-slice-of-bread-type looks.

And as he brings this chaos to order like it's the third day of creation, he realizes that it's all given him a chance to read some of the scattered texts and scripted, scrawling tumbles of letters that were humming like clusters of smashed bee hives all over the space of the house.
