Development of AI Chatbots

In pursuit of higher efficiency and cutting-edge solutions, Perdition Books embarked on a project to develop a series of artificial intelligence chatbots as tools to aid in content creation. These chatbots were designed to autonomously generate narrative content, thereby reducing the reliance on human authors and the associated costs of advances and royalties that such authors require. This initiative was a bold step towards integrating AI technology into creative publishing processes which has unfortunately failed.
