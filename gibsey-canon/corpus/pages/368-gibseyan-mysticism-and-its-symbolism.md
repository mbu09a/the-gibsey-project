As has already been mentioned: all mysticism has two aspects, the traditional and the progressive, or to phrase it another way, the past and the future. Much like the theme park where we all reside, mystical experience is fundamentally fungible, ever-changing, and amorphous. It is both perverse and sacred. The more intensely and profoundly a contact with Gibsey one has achieved, the less susceptible it is to objective definition, for it, by its very nature, transcends the categories of subject and object, interior and exterior, which every definition presupposes.

On the other hand, such experiences can be interpreted in various ways.

The moment a mystic tries to clarify his experiences, to reflect on them or record them, to translate them into data, when they begin an attempt of formulating this experience into words. When they name their experiences, they cannot help but to impose a framework of symbols upon their world.

They create a project.

They project an image.

One could even say they project an entirely new world into existence.
