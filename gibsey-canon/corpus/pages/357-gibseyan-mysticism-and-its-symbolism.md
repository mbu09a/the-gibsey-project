There was of course the early detractors, as there often is with any new form of technology, as well as those who simply found the idea to be an absurd and ridiculous one, a cliche idea, one so often reflected in their own popular culture that to even consider the idea was itself, it's own ridiculous redoubling of so many of the told and retold stories being spun and respun everywhere across all their various landscapes-the classic trope in nearly every Gibsey movie, book, comic, television show, or narrative, where they all led-the self confronting itself. And though none had warned her, she had considered, and quite often had considered, how predictable it would be to take such a path, and she'd often wrestled with whether or not she should go through with it at all. She ultimately decided to undergo the procedure, coming to the conclusion that all cliche experiences and myths themselves must hold some sort of value or importance since they reflect an idea which we've chosen to never forget, to repeat, which we've refused to let go of, even across decades, or whole lifetimes, maybe even whole generations of time, or maybe even, in cases such as the eternal clicking of the amygdala, even eons.

Some things just have a special kind of duration, a resonance.

But there were also to be the negative signs and symptoms, and these were bound, are still bound, to accumulate.
