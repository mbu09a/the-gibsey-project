At first, he'd considered giving a fake or disguised name, but he can sense this woman's dominance, and he probably can't pull it off anyways, so he bites the bullet and tells her the truth. "I'm Phillip Bafflemint, I'm the, uh, the detective assigned to the London Fox case, mamn. She's disappeared. Did you know her?"

"I do not."

Wait?

For a moment, it felt like a smile flashed across her face before shifting, but Phillip is unsure.

He's gonna keep his eye on this one, that's for certain.

She continues, "But that's a very strange detail to mention, Mr. Bafflemint. Most certainly. This is the house of Manny Valentinas, and he's also disappeared, and darling, I was the one who first prompted-I mean who first reported-his disappearance. Oh dear me, a slip of the tongue! Now you'll just have to question me as long as you like, Mr. Bafflemint, now that such an unfortunate mistake has occurred. My Gibsey, I'll just have to prove my innocence to you now, won't I?"
