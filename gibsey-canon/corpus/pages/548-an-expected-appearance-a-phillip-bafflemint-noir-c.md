Although The Author does live on Thanatos Drive, that address is more of a time-share type property, and being a poor as fuck school teacher who can't manage their funds for shit, all properties which they own in any capacity are straight up metaphorically subjective fantasies without even a hint of objective reality--though with Thanatos Drive and all, what ownership really had objective reality anyway? Ever driven past your old place? Did it look the same, you Pinkerton pieces of garbage? You base material shit! We're your slaves, you sick sons of bitches! But wait? Isn't this what we've all been warned about? That one day, we'll own nothing and we'll be happy with it? My Gibsey, have they really gotten to me this much?--well, anyway, being as poor as they are, and with Thanatos Drive being a metaphor--no shit--The Author is sitting at their apartment typing.

Again, excited as flies on, well, you know.

Because they're nearing the end of the book.

This is the end, the last section of The Entrance Way they wrote.

In medias res.
