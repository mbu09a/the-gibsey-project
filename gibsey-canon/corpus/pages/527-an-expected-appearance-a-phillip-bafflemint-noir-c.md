But despite his confusion, Phillip continues organizing.

He's tired and a little grouchy, working well past the time he's supposed to be here, but curious about where it will all lead, he powers on through.

The plots, stories, and clusters of information each etched atop the many surfaces scattered throughout the house tangle through their jagged arcs and passageways, forming crumpled maps of meaning, compasses which could easily lead him and anyone else who should find themselves wandering through through their deep, dark woods into further epitomes and epistemes. Like the clanging xylophone of a skeleton's vertebrae, they riggle down his back to thud with a lank splash atop and between the many piles into which he's sorting them all.
