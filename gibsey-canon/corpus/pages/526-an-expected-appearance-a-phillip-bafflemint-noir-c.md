"Alright then. Time for me to leave, Mr. Bafflemint. Toodaloo! I'll be three houses down. Do make sure to shut the door behind you when you leave. We don't want various strangers wandering in, now, do we? Though you may want to leave the door unlocked, always lots to return to in a quest-or case! Look at me, slipping up again! You take care now, darling!"

And with that, Judy S. Cargo hurries out into the night air, shutting the door behind her as she exits.

Phillip Bafflemint stands rooted to his spot, waiting in that cluttered, semi-flooded house, confounded as he so often is. He's not even sure how he managed to end up here, if he's glad he came, or if he ever really had a say in the matter to begin with.
