There was no more time.

They'd have to close the doorway,

The Entrance Way into The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey,

Once and for all.

And although they're still crying all the while,

Being the good mentee to the mentor that is their self,

They fall to their knees

And start filling the doorway in with clay,

Like some golem

Or homunculi,

And just as they're about to be done, just as the final piece is being shaped,

They hear a voice,

A whisper.

"Psssst. Hey, The Author. We're down here."
