As you've likely noticed, being the astute reader that you are, Glyph Marrow is not one of the most reliable of narrators, so when the singularity of his vision shifts at the opening of this very chapter—what's called his "point-of-view" by many—to an arguably different though also initially unnamed narrator, it may even suggest he's still the one that's narrating, though he (and we) can never really know for sure.

And this transition isn't a slow fade, either.

Vague ghostly figures with their faces hidden from view don't appear along the edges of his periphery like cigarette burns in a film or swirl like the stars that dance around Doofus' head when he's smacked with a frying pan.

No, the change is much more accelerated than that. It comes swimming up in an instant, or pouring out, one could say. It's as if Shamrock Stillman—that embodied disembodied voice of Glyph's partner—has snapped their fingers, and upon snapping, it all flashes into place, jump-cut, with the queue line no longer empty, and instead busy as ever, and also as promised, Glyph is at the front of the line.
