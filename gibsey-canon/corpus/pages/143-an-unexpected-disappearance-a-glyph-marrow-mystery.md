Not too bad.

But why hadn't they heard or noticed this before?

Why hadn't they anticipated the problem?

They could have avoided more wasted time if they'd simply been better at all this.

They were always wasting so much time.

Another of so many of their repeated obsessive failures.

And another especially acute one being how they were often perceived by others. By golly, did they think about that a lot!

The Author was always aware, hyper-aware, of the perceptions of others.

Such thoughts lurked within them like a rabid beast-chest heaving, jowls drooling, eyes blood-shot, teeth thrashing, snarling, spitting-tucked away in a hidey hole underneath the high school bleachers, waiting for its chance to attack.

One way they'd discovered, to vanquish this fear, being The Author after all, was writing. However, this didn't really help much because so much of their writing was a complete fantasy, and a failed fantasy at that, the worst kind.

And their writing had also simply added another item to the list of so many things they had left to do.

They had so much left to do.
