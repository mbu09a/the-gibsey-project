So The Author will continue.

They will continue this letter, even though they suspect Progresso won't read it.

They will continue their investigation, even though they suspect it won't lead to answers.

They will continue their work, even though they suspect it doesn't matter.

They will continue their existence, even though they suspect it might be fictional.

Because continuing is a choice.

And choice, even the illusion of choice, feels like agency.

And agency, even the illusion of agency, feels like life.

And life, even fictional life, feels better than nothing.

Which brings The Author to another realization, another insight they'd like to share with Progresso:

Maybe the question isn't whether we have agency.

Maybe the question is whether we can create the experience of agency.

Maybe the question isn't whether we're real.

Maybe the question is whether we can create the experience of reality.

Maybe the question isn't whether our choices matter.

Maybe the question is whether we can create the experience of mattering.

In other words, maybe agency isn't something you have or don't have.

Maybe agency is something you do or don't do.

Maybe agency is a practice rather than a possession.

Maybe agency is a verb rather than a noun.
