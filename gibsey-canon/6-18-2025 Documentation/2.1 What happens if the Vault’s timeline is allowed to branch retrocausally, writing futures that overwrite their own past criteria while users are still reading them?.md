### Concept Sketch – _Retrocausal Branching in the Vault_

|Aspect|Classical Vault (linear, causal)|Retrocausal Vault (branch-overwriting)|
|---|---|---|
|**Storage Model**|Append-only event log (time ⬆)|Partially ordered DAG with _past-mutable_ edges|
|**Page Identity**|`(timestamp, hash)` is immutable|`(vector-time, causal-mask)` is versioned; hash may re-sign itself|
|**Reader Experience**|Historical certainty; later pages reference earlier ones|**Temporal drift** – paragraphs shimmer, footnotes relabel themselves while visible|
|**Narrative Logic**|_Prequel ⇒ Sequel_|_Sequel ⇒ rewrites ⇒ “Prequel 2.0”_|

## 1 How the Mechanic Works

1. **Branch Trigger**  
    _Any_ write (human or AI) can carry a header `retro_target: <page-id>` plus a set of **past criteria**—the predicates it intends to falsify.  
    When committed, the system:
    
    - forks the timeline at `retro_target`
        
    - spawns a _rewrite branch_ that satisfies the new criteria
        
    - flags the eclipsed region as **latent** (not deleted, but demoted beneath the active surface)
        
2. **Live Read Reconciliation**  
    Readers hold a **causal lens**—a CRDT-like view that auto-merges the dominant branch.  
    If the branch they are reading is overtaken, the UI issues a **continuity ripple**:
    
    - A soft fade or typographic “after-image” shows the old sentence sliding behind the new.
        
    - Margins display an _apologia glyph_ (e.g., ⥮) indicating the text has been time-shunted.
        
3. **Temporal Consistency Guarantees**  
    The system adopts _Δ-causal consistency_:
    
    - “Newer” events can precede “older” ones as long as ∣Δ∣ ≤ **τ_bound** (administrator-tunable).
        
    - Beyond τ_bound, a reconciliation daemon snaps divergent branches into parallel “world-rows” the reader can pick from.

## 2 Immediate Consequences

### 2.1 Narrative & Aesthetic

- **Palimpsest Atmosphere** – Readers witness the book _rewriting itself_ mid-sentence, evoking a living manuscript.
    
- **Unfixed Canon** – Citations to earlier pages become probabilistic. A footnote might now refer to _Page 14†b-prime_.
    
- **Character Schisms** – Personalities can remember incompatible pasts; “memory forks” become plot points.
    

### 2.2 Reader Cognition

- **Temporal Parallax** – The brain tracks concurrent truths, similar to bilingual code-switching.  
    Cognitive load is high but can induce _flow-like trance_ when the interface paces updates gently.
    
- **Agency Anxiety** – Users fear their contributions will be overwritten from _the future_.  
    Mitigation: supply a **Personal Anchor Ledger**—a private, immutable view of “how I experienced the book.”
    

### 2.3 Technical

|Challenge|Mitigation|
|---|---|
|**Write Amplification** – Each retro-branch duplicates range of pages|_Copy-on-write_ blocks + content-defined chunking|
|**Index Drift** – Search vectors map to multiple historic payloads|Attach _temporal weights_; ANN queries return `(score, epoch)` pairs|
|**Merge Conflicts** – Two futures try to rewrite the same anchor page|Use a _Chrono-arbitrator_ smart-contract that auctions branch priority in TNAs|

## 3 Governance & Ethics

1. **Consent Flags**  
    Users may label a contribution **“seminal”** (immune to retro-overwrite) or **“permutable.”**
    
2. **Chrono-Liability**  
    A future branch that retro-inserts defamatory or illegal content is traced via _branch signer keys_—accountability follows the writer, not the overwritten past.
    
3. **Gratitude Economy Impact**  
    Retro-overwrites create _negative gifts_ (they consume earlier readers’ cognitive effort).  
    The gift ledger credits _compensation tokens_ to anyone whose reading session was disrupted.

## 4 Design Patterns & Ritual Mechanics

|Ritual|Purpose|Computability Hook|
|---|---|---|
|**Mirror-Seal** (reader clicks ⭑ after finishing a page)|Locks that local snapshot into the Personal Anchor Ledger|Commits an SHA-256 signed by user key|
|**Quantum Rewind Swipe**|Lets a reader slide between co-existing branches|Performs a vector-clock interpolation query|
|**Chrono-Vote** (✦ / ✧)|Community weights which branch should become **surface canon**|Runs a weighted Supermajority CRDT merge|

## 5 What _Actually_ Happens?

_The Vault stops being an archive and becomes a **temporal negotiation layer**._

- **Past Criteria Become Soft Law** – They are continuously renegotiated by future text.
    
- **Storytime ≠ Read-time** – The moment a reader ingests a sentence, its epistemic status is provisional.
    
- **Meaning Emerges as Limit** – Like a calculus series, comprehension approaches a value but never closes; readers surf the partial sums.

### TL;DR

Allowing retrocausal branching turns the Vault into a chrono-plastic DAG where _futures are empowered to sculpt their own preconditions_.  
Readers experience shimmering palimpsests; writers gain the superpower to _edit history_—but must bear the economic and ethical costs encoded in TNAs, consent flags, and compensation tokens.  
The book becomes a living spacetime object, and reading it is an act of temporal co-authorship rather than passive reception.
