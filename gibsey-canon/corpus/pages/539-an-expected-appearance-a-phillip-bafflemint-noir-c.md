He types in the address of his apartment at the Ecco Resort Hotel on his GPS, but nothing comes up.

Was there no home for him to go to then?

What?

Does that mean he's totally directionless?

Wait, this isn't some "lost generation" type bull shit is it?

That would mean that not only is he postmodern, but-my Gibsey, it was even worse!--it was going even further back than that--no, NO!?--into, dear Gibsey, modernism.

The horror, the utter horror!

Knowing nowhere else he can go, he tries typing 19991 Thanatos Drive into his GPS.

You know what?

That could be the street name for most of the streets in this damn city, some voice grumbles at him.

What?

Hello?

Is someone there?

He tries ignoring whatever that voice had been, be it ghostly visitation, angelic whisper, or schizophrenic crack up, but his body can't ignore it. Gooseflesh crawls down his forearms, the air in his vehicle turns cold, and he can sense some dizzies about to come on, though there's at least some relief, however brief it may be, because 19991 Thanatos Drive does manage to show up on his GPS.

OK, thank Gibsey.
