The thought first came to Jack on a previous Thursday, light ricocheting in through the blinds to splash perpendicular across the cream-white walls of his office, coming to him through the liminal zone between 4 and 5pm where it's quietly acceptable to leave the A.D.D. offices, a time which also holds the unspoken rule-what is an office without its unspoken rules?-that if one does leave between 4 and 5pm often enough, then one's work-ethic and reliability may increasingly come into question despite the fact that no one does anything at all between 4 and 5pm. Which is likely why, while waiting to stay in the office long enough to seem productive without having to actually do so, this thought came to Jack. It involved yet another thing missing from the game he hoped to code, something he decided the game may even be missing more than anything else: the concept of family.

And in this way, Jack was similar to the game he was hoping to create: he was missing his family. But it was less that he missed their presence from his life than he experienced their absence from it. Or even better, it wasn't that he was missing them, it was that he was missing from them.
