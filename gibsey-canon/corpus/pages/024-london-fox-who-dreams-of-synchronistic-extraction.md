And she watches in horror as every follicle, every pore, every hair, every flake, the shell that contains her within her own self, all the way down to the very molecules and atoms which animate her, she watches it all burst forth into a blinding light, into the model of itself, a fractal imitation of itself which it, itself, has built, a synchronistic mystery extracted from the very beginning, becoming, and ever disintegrating.

She watches as the words of the system which she has created, the windowed mirror within which she peers out of and from within, within herself, the landscape within which she waits, the screen of her self, she watches how—she watches—she watches how her body moves out of itself and into the cells of her own creation.

And into it, she vertically disintegrates, forever.
