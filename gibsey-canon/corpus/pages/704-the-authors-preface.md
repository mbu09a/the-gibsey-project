The Author and their sister used to play The Game of Life, a board game that involved simulating many popularly accepted as essential life experiences: going to college, having children, getting a job, changing careers, buying a home, and ending up at an old folks center.

A very strange and surreal fucking board game to say the least.

When playing The Game of Life, one of its most iconic features is a plastic spinner in the center of the game board. The clicking twirl of its rainbow wheel spinning in place, musical when mixed with the deep suspicion that your sister might have cheated in her shuffling of the cards she's about to read from, cards which will then determine the game of your own life for you.

Twirl, twirl, twirl the spinner on the board.

You place the blue or pink pieces into their positions within the cars and drive them around the game board.

You perform a whole life across the course of this game.

The spokes of a wheel, 1-10, the spinner in the center, a random number generator of fate, and each number on the spinner is a different position, a different landscape that will be reached arbitrarily, but there is a system to the game being played, a structure, an organization, an institution, the spinner.

Only 10 options are available, each turn, when you move within the game.

Movement from place to place.

Movement between landscapes, between myths, a game board.

The Game of Life is a mask meant to be worn, to be played, a performance.
