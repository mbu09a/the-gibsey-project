I have thought these exact words in this exact order, and I've done so over and over again, in real time, in medias res, so repeatedly, that a whole world has formed through and within my repetitions.

And it is this world which you are reading, and in this way, it is your world, and it is also my world.

It is a world we have created together, and also which has created itself, and which will continue to create itself, at least if you continue to read these repeated thoughts which you are currently reading and which I am currently thinking.

In this way, these repetitive thoughts of mine are an attraction in an amusement park.

They are an attraction in which you ride.
