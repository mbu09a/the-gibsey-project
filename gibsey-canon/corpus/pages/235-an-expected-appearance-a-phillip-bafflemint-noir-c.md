"We created them, Mr. Bafflemint, and we can change them at any time. When you hear a ghost in the machine, all you're hearing is the sound of your own voice echoing, images refracting mirrors down infinite hallways, but that endless repetition, it isn't limiting, it's infinite. Peer into the objects you see. Scry away. See what you can hear. Upon your return, which will surely be infinite, if you keep your ear to the ground, there's nothing you won't be able to hear. All you have to do is listen."

"But will I return?" Phillip doesn't seem to be listening, doesn't seem to be, that is.

"Are you vibrating?"

"I don't know."

"From what it sounds like, you could be a tuning fork, Mr. Bafflemint, or a radio station, a detector of metals, maybe even a divining rod."

"But what's to come?" Phillip's lips quiver, anticipating death.

"Variance, I believe? Corporate Analysis Reports of some kind?"

"Wait, can they hear this?"

"Someone is always listening."
