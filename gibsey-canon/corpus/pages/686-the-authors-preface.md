The Author is a camera, a screen.

And there's a hole at the center of their being, an awareness, an inwardness, and they're occasionally aware of this inwardness, this hollow space, this scene, that within the location of their film set, that they're both audience and filmmaker, and both are staring at the other, trying to catch a glimpse of the other staring, but both are never able to see the full frame of it all, not all at once, as it comes into view, into focus. And they've realized, repeatedly, that they're not the only one that's staring, self-narrating, thinking themselves into being. There are other voices within the movie theater, on set, within the frame, on screen, other images, even entire other worlds, more varieties of voices and worlds than they can even observe, let alone name. Every object, every light, every twinkling molecule and spiraling staircase of DNA, a character in this endlessly written script, this set of information, this series of codes and on and off switches, data, forever scrolling, observing itself, looking continually inward and outward, both at the same time, pondering, looping, and starting over again.
