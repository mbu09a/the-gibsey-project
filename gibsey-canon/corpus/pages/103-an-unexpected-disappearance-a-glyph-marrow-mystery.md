Despite the tangled mass of fear, anger, and loneliness, all his confusion and ignorance, despite all of the stalactites of words creeping down on him from above, Glyph is seized with an awareness of loss, of a loss to come, the many losses to come, an awareness which if he's experienced it before, he's surely forgotten what it felt like. It feels like an inner bruise, like being bruised not from the outside-in but from the inside-out, to suddenly know that he's losing something.

But what is it he's losing?

What is it that he's lost?

Arieol rubs Glyph's back, cooing him like a damned baby, for Gibsey's sake, but it seems to work.

Glyph does calm down a bit, resorting to gasps of air in and and out and in and out and in.
