It begins with an interior, within an interior.

The lime-greens walls of a psychiatrist's office where, in Jr. High, The Author was diagnosed with ADHD. Their grades were slipping down below acceptable thresholds and their mother wasn't having any of it.

There had to be some sort of explanation.

"They'll either sink or swim," the Texas History teacher said (and yes astute reader, you read that correctly, this was an actual class at the time: Texas History) during the parent-teacher conference, this being a hint of another interior and exterior, drifting further down into the waves, or rising above them, selfhood, if any was at all possible within such a localized environment.

There just isn't enough time, is there?

Interesting how the brain itself is a landscape which maps itself upon itself, synapses firing like cars on a highway, random memories stored like data on a CPU: Remember the Alamo, Jim Bowie's knife, San Jacinto, the violence of independence.

Maybe educators should just build time machines for their more unmotivated students, or wait for the time machine of life to do its own work, to thrust them, to project them, forever forward, or backward, depending on one's angle, to wait until a later point in the unfolding narrative, when the timeline starts to unwind and scurry about, when the landscape of the brain ignites like a Christmas tree coming alight on the Fourth of July, like lines of people, crowded together, waiting, for a firework show to begin.

There is no landscape that isn't perceived, and being perceived is what creates a given landscape.

And the true terror of experience is that you can create them, any landscape that you want, you can pretend them into existence, you can manifest them, any landscape, at any given time.

And any landscape is all other landscapes.

So, where to begin?

Where to begin.
