"No, it's simpler than that," I try to explain to my doctor, "More abstract. At least I think it is. When I see that clipboard, I know it's the word clipboard, right? That's what represents it, the word clipboard. Do you understand? But I also see it as a clipboard that isn't a word, that's also just a clipboard. It's a really strange sensation. I'm seeing both at once, and I don't understand how I can perceive both at once. And I didn't always experience this sensation. Whatever it is, whatever's happening, it wasn't always like this. I'm not even sure what it is that's happening to me by seeing them this way, but I know that whatever it is, it isn't normal. It's different. It's not what it once was. It's different than it was before. Something within me has changed, forever."

"Well, is this, um, feeling, that you're having, is it interfering with your life? This ailment of yours?"

"Well, no, not exactly. That clipboard is a clipboard. But it just doesn't make any sense!"

I think I put my head in my hands by that point, exasperated.

"Well," The doctor adds, matter of factly, "When I look at this clipboard, I also see a clipboard, right? So how is that a problem for you, exactly?" He smiles at me, trying to show me that everything's OK, that nothing's wrong, that he's trying to help me. "I'm just trying to understand."

"It just is."

The fact is, he didn't understand.
