To remind you, before settling on Parlance, Arieol's been searching for Variance, Jacklyn Variance, and unable to find them, he's temporarily wondered if Parlance has created the whole plot as some sort of cover, meaning that he's maybe even been the one to write Jacklyn Variance's Analysis Documents, and though it's still possible, they've shifted to another possibility, another possible identity of The Author, Arieol themself.
