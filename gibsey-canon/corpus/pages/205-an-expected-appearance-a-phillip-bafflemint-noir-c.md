It's this sort of headspace, or his search for one, as such, that's also made him maintain things in his apartment as clean and minimally as he so often has. There's nothing in the place but a table with two chairs, a few essentials cooking items left in his kitchen, a set of TV-trays in the living room, his couch and the television set which he's put on a night stand, his bed, a book shelf with a few books, almost none of which he's read other than a few of the scattered detective novels, books like An Unexpected Disappearance, that he'll occasionally peruse on long nights when he's far away from sleep.

There's not much personality to Phillip Bafflemint and he likes it that way.

He'd always wanted to keep things neat, tidy, and simple-this wasn't quite a full on motto of his, but he at least tried to live by it, tried to always throw away his TV dinners every evening, tried to always make sure any of the dirty dishes were cleaned, that the trash was taken out, that all of his daily tasks were taken care of.

He wasn't completely alone, there were friends he talked to and reached out to when necessary, but everyone has their own form of loneliness, afterall.
