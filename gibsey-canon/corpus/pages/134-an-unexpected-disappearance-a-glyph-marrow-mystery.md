I'm not meaning to give spoilers away-though what is with this contemporary idea of spoilers? It's about as linear and uncreative as Gibsey World itself or postmodernism or the concept of the West or anything else. If the book or story is any good, it can't be spoiled. Can you spoil the Iliad? Can you spoil the Divine Comedy? Can you spoil the Corpus? I mean, come on, spoilers in a good work of art don't exist in my humble opinion-but later this is seen as more of a breakdown or a possible invasion or possession, though again, both aren't dissimilar and Glyph is unreliable, so I'm not sure. The suit, again, is gray and has to be, at least if Jackaroo is to disguise herself, as such.

One last question.

Oh! How the alchemical process relates here, very interesting
