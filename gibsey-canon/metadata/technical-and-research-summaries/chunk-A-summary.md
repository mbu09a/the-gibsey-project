# Chunk A Summary: 6‑18 to 6‑21 2025 Documentation

This summary covers research notes and architecture prompts collected in the dated‑research folders (6‑18 through 6‑21 2025). These documents form the conceptual foundation for the Gibsey Novel OS, exploring narrative mechanics, data architectures, gifting economies, and CI‑driven corpus management workflows.

## Key Themes
1. **Metafictional Mechanics** – Brainstorm how recursive narrative structures, liminality, and glyph orientations map onto runtime behaviors and UX rituals.
2. **Infrastructure Poetry** – Speculative designs for symbolic vector flows, self-sharding databases, and dramaturgic fault injection as story events.
3. **Gifting & Economy Models** – Exploration of micro‑gifts, scarcity simulations, and collective epiphanies as governance and reward mechanisms.
4. **Corpus Freeze & CI** – Detailed plans for splitting the monolithic JSON into Markdown pages, metadata extraction workflows, linting, and automated diff checks to ensure consistency.
5. **Tokenizer & Context** – Follow‑up notes on custom tokenization strategies, context-window experiments, and documentation synthesis for better developer ergonomics.

## Open Questions
- How to formalize a metaphor compiler that bridges user metaphors to executable functions?
- What governance emerges when time‑based gifting becomes symmetrical or retrocausal?
- How can CI processes enforce 1:1 sync between page files and metadata entries?
- What safeguards prevent reader psychogenesis in hyper‑empathetic UX designs?
- Which architectural patterns best align with recursive narrative events (e.g. hyperbolic vs. fractal geometries)?

## Next Steps / TODOs
- Assign issue tickets for implementing the corpus-splitting script and CI pipelines.
- Prototype the custom tokenizer and measure token‑cost impacts for long‑context workflows.
- Refine the fault‑injector agent design to integrate with the story scheduler.
- Consolidate all follow‑up notes into a central architecture review document.
