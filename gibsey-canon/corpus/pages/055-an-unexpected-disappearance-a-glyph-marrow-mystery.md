Their objects. And all that's held within them. They contain so much more than I could ever perceive, let alone think. And speaking of, the words, the words they form, they form a message, a piece of dialogue, a set of dialogue, and it doesn't come quite flowing out like a thought bubble in a comic strip, but it may as well be one?
