And this was (and is still is) a conflict which will continue to occur, and is a problem which will also be further developed later within the unfolding of this introductory narrative, but before that conflict becomes too further developed, it may be important to stop and to be clear, once again, about one last source of identification, or to put this another way, to identify another conflict, or--if this conflict isn't another conflict and is instead a similar conflict--to attempt to make a distinction. It may be important to try to locate the setting of this unfolding narrative that's being constructed in medias res, to name another name among an infinite set of names, and to choose this name at random, and therefore, to create the setting of this unfolding narrative, once and for all, meaning the setting being constructed in medias res by The Author, a setting that both was and still is unfolding within both The Author's early work and the setting of the unfolding narrative that's being constructed in medias res. It is a setting that is (and was) often described as the most magical place on Earth, and it likely is the most magical place on Earth, it was, and it will continue to be.

The landscape in question, the one being referred to, the one being constructed in medias res, the landscape is (and was) called Gibsey World.

It is the Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey.
