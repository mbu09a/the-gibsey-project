It may be a road that's thrusting him downward towards confusion, entropy, and--for all he knew-death, but at least he had somewhere to go, a direction.

He drives back to the house as quickly as he can, doing his best to not yell at the idiotic drivers that dominate this superbly overrated land.

He gulps air into his lungs, tensing.

Maybe these drivers, slow and stupid as they are, were a psycho-pump leading him to some underworld?

Or maybe he was already there?

And always had been.

Or maybe he was already his own psychopomp?

He shivers.

Although still at the edge of collapsing in terror while hurtling towards Thanatos Drive, a piece of data about Judy S. Cargo manages to return to comfort him.

Before leaving the house, she'd claimed to live three houses down.

Thank Gibsey.

He isn't sure he can trust her, and if anything, it wasn't even likely, but there's at least that lead he can follow if the mystery of this case-if not reality itself-continues to totally unravel.

He continues to stare out around him as he drives.

Everything in Gibsey World was so much more organized than this damn place.
