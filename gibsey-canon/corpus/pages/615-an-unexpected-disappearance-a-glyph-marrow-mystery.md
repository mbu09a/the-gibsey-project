It should be expected then that Boundaryland would be the most expansive area of the park, and it was, taking up one-third of Gibseyland's 60 acre plot, much of it dominated by the Rivers of the Frontier section of the park which houses the Mark Twain Riverboats that can still be seen in many of that park's modern recreations floating their way across the streams of that woodland delta.

Budgets were tight in the park's early days, and the Riverboat existed as the singular mechanical attraction of the area, at least until the Rainbow Revene Mine Train ride was later conceived as budgets were expanded and further construction was implemented after the park's iconic initial success.

Boundaryland was inspired by the ghost towns which themselves had been transported into a similar Californian theme park which Gibsey drew inspiration from, Tangleberry Farm, drawing from much of that park's frontier theming, its stagecoaches, pack mules, wagons, among other similar diaspora, and it was these sorts of thematic resonances that Malt was going for when it came to constructing this area of the park and the ride which would provide the early inspiration for the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument ride, the Rainbow Revene Mine Train. The ride was to be an educational journey through nature similar in style to that of the nature documentaries Malt Gibsey Studios were known for developing at the time.
