A few other images which they'd just printed out because they'd found them thematically resonant, a Mobius strip, Louis Wain's drawings of cats that got more progressively deranged over time, the photo of a pyramid with the lyrics of Radiohead's Pyramid Song taped onto it which gives them nausea even just considering mentioning--such a popular band and all-but the fact was, they'd listened to the song probably 500 times in the past year, so it should probably show up somewhere. Probably had something to do with the feeling of purgatory it provided them. It had felt like something they should live in for a while, at the time, and there was also another set of lyrics they'd printed and thumb nailed down, a section from the Mitski song Geyser, which somehow felt less embarrassing to mention, maybe because the lyrics were more actively relevant:

Though I'm a geyser  Feel it bubbling from below Hear it call, hear it call  Hear it call to me  Constantly And hear the harmony Only when its harming me It's not real, it's not real  It's not real enough
