Yep, that's it. That's the one. That's what was selected, The X of Swords.

Would-ya-look-at-that. A man face down on the ground with ten knives protruding from his back.

What-the-ever-living-fuck?

Jumping Gibsey, you can't make this shit up, folks.

This is what your pal Arieol truly yanked out from the deck as if pulling a rabbit out of their own ass, ladies and gentle-germs, and right after writing/picturing that image.

If you don't even shove it up there yourself, is it even a magic trick? Or is it something else? Something with a much greater intensity of effect?

It certainly wasn't one they'd intended, and wasn't that what magic was supposed to be about, harnessing intention?

Did having the card here, without turning it over, have some sort of an effect they weren't aware of? Or was it the opposite? Was it the cannibalism they'd imagined which had produced this most violent of cards (or images)?

And additionally, was it their foolishness, already well summarized by that Fool card swinging in at the top of the game's 1st inning that had led them to such a fate?

But wasn't a fool, The Fool, something to be protected from harm, or which was protected from harm?

Or was that merely the non-reversed reading?

Maybe they should be considering negative possibilities, after all.

Wouldn't want positivity-bias to be all a-fuckin' it up.
