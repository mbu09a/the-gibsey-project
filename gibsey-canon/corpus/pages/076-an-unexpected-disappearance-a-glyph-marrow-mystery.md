It would seem that the tree of Glyph's fear has shifted to a possibly deeper root: total frustration. Here he is, at the foot of the first hill of everything he's dreamed of while wandering through whatever strange memories have been left over by his ailment's litany of scattered worlds, and there's this chatterer before him who won't stop talking, narrating, monologuing, dialoguing—whatever they want to call it—vomiting words at him, and it's starting to feel like their job here was to ruin it all for him, to ruin the only experience he's ever even had.

It seems, for Glyph anyway, that Arieol's been sent here to keep him from experiencing the ride that was meant for him and him alone.

There's also another fear within Glyph, a deep and repeated fear, one he's grown comfortable with, a fear that's hammocked itself, feet back, pina colada in hand, against the edge of his skull, a fear that ain't gettin' up for anybody, a fear that's fully relaxed and nestled within himself, deep, deep down, unmoving: he's too afraid to speak up for himself. Wouldn't want to interrupt. He opens his mouth to say something to stop it all from happening, to get them moving again, but all he manages to get out is, "The First Ascent?"

A question?

He had to be a fucking idiot and ask Arieol Owlist a fucking question.
