This is what they had learned together, both what they'd be warned and what they'd experienced, both the original and new versions of Natalie, during an early period of training they'd done together, the not-required but highly encouraged training that immediately proceeds all cloning procedures. All cloned selves must be trained, at least if they were to retain the personality of the original version's self, though there is a growing debate in the industry, as there ever is, about how truly necessary these training processes actually are, the point often made by this supposedly problematic minority being that such training, if anything, warps the newer clone's ability to decide for itself, transforming it from its otherwise free, pure, and blameless state into one of corruption since it puts the sincerity of the Agency-as it's described in the literature-of the clone's new self into question. And of course there were others, of a much more anxious and much less focused, and certainly less successful variety, who just oscillated between the two incessantly depending on the context, living in a state of heightened reactivity and uncomfortability, between the two, both out of terror of giving and receiving too much or too little, in either case, and ultimately, achieving very little of either option, or at least being constantly dissatisfied with both options, as anyone becomes after being exposed to the same amusement for too extended of a time, and if anything, this was the most natural place which the trainings to achieve Agency within a cloning procedure all led, including Natalie and Natalie's, even early within their training process together. The first time it occurred, or at least the first time they'd noticed it, the new version of Natalie was cooking a recipe, one which the original Natalie hadn't liked.
