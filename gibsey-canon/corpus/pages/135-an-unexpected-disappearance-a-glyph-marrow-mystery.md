I don't have a ton of time, but I'd love to at least partially tackle this.

So, in Gibseyan Mysticism, the end goal of the alchemical process is the Philosopher's Shit, a substance thought to take base material which has been shat clean from a human, well, um, a human ass, into the purity and grace of spun gold, a symbol of eternal life.

Oh, yes. I'm dead serious.

Yes, from shit.

Absolutely.

That's what it's called, and well, they're called 'based' metals are they not? And wasn't the whole thing supposed to be symbolic anyway?

I never said it wasn't serious!

Well, of course!

What? Turning shit into gold?

Well an eldritch beast type monster is about as eternal as it gets.

What isn't natural or material?

And I'd think relieving oneself is about as natural of a process as one gets.

You've all taken a shit, I assume?

The Author is supposed to have had religious revelations while, well, we'll just leave that one to your base imaginations.
