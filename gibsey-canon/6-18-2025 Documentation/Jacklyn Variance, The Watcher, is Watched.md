Text(s) in Question: The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, An Unexpected Disappearance, An Expected Appearance, Various Untitled Selections, Jack Parlance Who Misses His Family, and The Biggest Shit of All Time

Report Code: X293-476-8923F

  

The document(s) currently under analysis are a set of textual materials both found and likely written within the compound’s underground tunnels titled, The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey and considers Jack Parlance as a possible subversive agent, as well as a possible author of both texts. Funding for this project is meager, and the personnel assigned to this analytical task is that of a singular individual, so the specific purpose of the current analysis has yet to be established by any authority at the present moment. As a result, the analysis of the documents in question will likely lack the depth, clarity, or rigor required to evaluate a series of texts of this specific length and kind. However, upon an initial evaluation of the text(s) in question, it is clear that the text itself does contain a certain amount of mystery and intrigue. The preliminary area of analysis which has left a mysterious impression on the current evaluator is the undecidability of whether or not The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, as a series of collective documents, were initially created as a work of fiction or were instead created as a set of works intended to document a contemporary reality. At the present moment, the sections that are under evaluation do not provide enough substantial evidence to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the work’s fictive or realistic inceptions. However, the process of analysis regarding this set of documents has just begun, and there will likely be many future reports regarding this specific area of inquiry. As the analysis proceeds, a suggested mode of operational procedure for future analysts could involve evaluations that consider both possibilities simultaneously. This form of analysis is most highly suggested for future evaluators pursuing further analysis, either in response to this individual Analysis Document or other documents later to be written.

As corporate agents working for the Agency of Data and Detection, we do our best to remain objective, unbiased, and impartial as possible regarding the data and textual documents we are hired to evaluate, and therefore must suspend our own sense of both reality and unreality, as well as our subjective and informal interests when evaluating such material. However, without a clear functional purpose provided by the Media Analysis State Services departments, or by A.D.D. itself, aside from the directive to pursue continued analysis of the texts and individuals in question, the current evaluator will be forced to eventually take subjective and informal methods. This unfortunate procedural choice will also likely need to be made due to the lack of personnel and funding currently being provided for the project. This lack of formality will be used at an absolute minimum basis, and an objective analysis of such texts will always be attempted when possible, and as often as possible, as is expected to occur within Daily A.D.D. Yearly Summary Documents. Whenever an inevitable exception to this will be made in future analysis reports, such situations will be made evidently and explicitly clear. To briefly and temporarily switch into 1st person and make myself clearer in a more temporarily individualized and subjective manner: I will only provide subjective commentary of this kind, such as I am doing now, when it is absolutely necessary.  

But as mentioned previously, Agents working for A.D.D. must remain as objective as possible regarding all forms of analysis, and must attempt to do so, at all times. However, it is essential to note that the nature of the text in question has already made this form of objective analysis a problematic and difficult task to accomplish. Despite this difficulty, the values of the M.A.S.S., as well as A.D.D., must and will remain steadfast, strong, and consistent, and the evaluator will be staying consistent to the values and procedures of the M.A.S.S. within this document, as well as within their future analysis reports. 

The area of concern which will be discussed in the next series of reports will be the possible identity of the text’s unknown author. Within future investigations into the text’s content, who and what the author may be, their possible gender, race, sexuality, methods, intentions, exigencies, and biases, each is bound to become an important and separate area for future analysis. Attached is the first document that will be used for analytical purposes, a section titled Jack Parlance Who Misses His Family. The content of this document alone already raises concerns about its unknown author’s possible ties to Anti-Corporate and Anti-State ideas and activities, ideas that are clearly becoming more and more popularly circulated throughout the underground complexes of the theme park where both the current evaluator lives, and where, logically based on the location where The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey documents are continually being discovered, the unknown author also likely resides. 

The current evaluator mentions this detail of life within the underground complexes within this report before continuing their analysis of the text in question because it may become an important factor, as well as a possible subjective bias within the work of their continued analysis of the text in question. The M.A.S.S/ and A.D.D. do not entirely discourage personal biases of this kind to be included in Analysis documentation as long as they are documented and self-consciously addressed within Daily A.D.D. Yearly Analysis Reports, such as this one. 

Our field is dominated by data, our economy, society, and the underground tunnels where many of us live are monitored and ruled over by data. Because of this, keeping relevant and consistent documentation reigns supreme. As long as subjective experiences are documented, they can remain, at least in part, justified. The data of our world, and its infinite, collective benefits, will eventually save and redeem us all. This document is merely one of an endless part of that circular, endless, and monumental process. 

 In mentioning this, the current elevator implores other Data and Information Researchers, Scientists, and Analysts who may or may not come across the current evaluator’s Daily Corporate Analysis Reports to keep the transparency of the aforementioned bias—the fact of contemplating life in the underground complex of the current M.A.S.S.—in mind regarding future evaluations of this document and other documents like it. Admittedly, the current subject being evaluated as a possible subversive individual is one who has been forced to live underground for the entirety of their lives. They have never left the park’s underground passages due to Corporate Regulations against such possible actions. The evaluator in question, however, has the privilege of operating aboveground, and therefore, could be biased against the contrasting common background, context, and personal bias of someone living below ground. Because of this, it is important to note that no Anti-Corporate or Anti-State tendencies have thus far been located or documented within the record of the current evaluator, Jacklyn Variance, who is writing this document of analysis. The current evaluator mentions this because they would very much like to keep their record clear and blameless in this exact way despite the content of the documents they will be analyzing. Others who will evaluate this Analysis Document in the future should not interpret the Anti-State and Anti-Corporate implications that the evaluator eventually finds and analyzes in the documents of The Wonderful World of Gibsy, An Unexpected Disappearance, An Expected Appearance, Jack Parlance Who Misses His Family, or the Biggest Shit of All Time as reflective of the social or political views of the current evaluator. These should instead be a reflection of the views of the unknown author who should, hopefully, be more clearly identified in future documents as data about the work in question is further organized, revealed, and analyzed. 

Annotations included within the text are to be linked through hyperlinked extensions. Future Data and Information Researchers, Scientists, and Analysts can access these notes or annotations through clicking on the hyperlinks included within the text itself and are also welcome to add their own annotations which the current evaluator can both approve and disapprove of upon their completion. 

Lastly, the current evaluator is at an absolute loss as to where the exact location of the setting within the document is meant to entirely exist. This is another aspect of the document that puts the work’s fictive and realistic elements into question, as mentioned earlier. The current evaluator would assume, based on descriptions of the setting within the text, that the document’s action takes place within Walt Disney World, the current corpus of the M.A.S.S. that is rumored to exist above the surface of the underground tunnels, but currently, this assertion, assumption, or inference, for the moment, is unverifiable. The setting, alternately, is described as existing within Malt Gibsy World, an alternative setting that seems to mirror that of the Walt Disney World complex. Why this choice was specifically made by The Author is currently unknown, but this choice will and should be parsed out within future Analysis Documents.

Now becoming a researcher of the underground, and evaluating an individual who has not yet been able to enter the surface, the current evaluator is especially unable to verify whether even Disney World itself is, truly, the contemporary corpus of the M.A.S.S. since this question does not pertain to their current research. It is entirely possible that Malt Gibsy World is instead the more accurate reality above the surface and that Walt Disney World is what exists underground.  Whether this collective notion is correct, or whether the setting of The Wonderful World of Gibsey is the more accurate and real representation of the existence of life above ground regarding the mediated state of our world is an area of continual uncertainty which the current evaluator will have to determine and explore further in future analysis documents. 

If, as a Data and Information Researcher, Scientist, or Analyst, you have become distracted by the many forms of analysis, repetitive justifications, and questions of the above document, the current evaluator apologizes for these possible infractions of protocol. However, they must persist in their analysis. Under the many pressures that exist due to a lack of funding, as well as the singular nature of their current evaluative task in collective to the Corporate M.A.S.S., the current evaluator would like to emphasize that they are very much doing their best. The following document provides access to the first text in question:  This document appears to be one part of many that will warrant future analysis. As mentioned, the current author of the preceding text has yet to be identified, but further analysis will consider the A.D.D. agent Jack Parlance, whom the current evaluator is monitoring and who is also the named character within the said document. This and future Analysis Report Documents in this series will consider Parlance as the possible author. A short description of Parlance’s activities and whereabouts is to  be provided after the following attached document.

Text(s) in Question: Jack Parlance Who Misses His Family [Attached Below]

Report Code: X482-572-2176G

  

The thought first came to Jack on a previous Thursday, light ricocheting in through the blinds to splash perpendicular across the cream-white walls of his office, coming to him through the liminal zone between 4 and 5pm where it’s quietly acceptable to leave the A.D.D. offices, a time which also holds the unspoken rule—what is an office without its unspoken rules?—that if one does leave between 4 and 5pm often enough, then one’s work-ethic and reliability may increasingly come into question despite the fact that no one does anything at all between 4 and 5pm. Which is likely why, while waiting to stay in the office long enough to seem productive without having to actually do so, this thought came to Jack. It involved yet another thing missing from the game he hoped to code, something he decided the game may even be missing more than anything else: the concept of family. 

And in this way, Jack was similar to the game he was hoping to create: he was missing his family. But it was less that he missed their presence from his life than he experienced their absence from it. Or even better, it wasn’t that he was missing them, it was that he was missing from them. 

Three years ago—a redundancy, aside from the corporate clock that hurdled them all through transportative blurs of ever increasing speeds, no one really kept track of time anymore, or at least no one had the capacity to any longer—Jack had abandoned his family. However, in his mind, they’d abandoned him. He felt he’d been left with no other choice but to do so. All he’d done was enact the bitter conclusion of all of their dysfunctional logic, a logic which had existed from the very beginning. 

And maybe he was right? 

Maybe they had and maybe it had? 

Their initial protests to the contrary only ever seemed to reinforce this view of his. 

But the realization—the missing piece of the game, incorporating the subject of family, that restless root that so much, so many, of his world(s) revolved around, but which for him, now represented only one rotating body of so many (and if so, within such a metaphor, what was then to become his sun?)—it provided no comfort to him, and if anything, it only caused him even more distress. 

Family was the center of both Gibsey itself and Gibsey World, or it was certainly claimed and popularly admonished as being so. It existed as the subject of so many of its classics. From Tolstoy’s repetitiously unhappy families to the infinite difference of Everything Everywhere All at Once, nearly every Gibsey product pointed back to the same thing: family.

Its absence from the game represented another idea he’d struggled to write, and would continue to struggle to write, let alone code, yet another problem which would be impossible for him to solve. How was he to consider how to incorporate his family, when the thought of them alone, itself, was too painful to even consider? 

Everything he’d do from now on, ever since he’d left them, would go against everything he’d ever known before.

He was treading on new ground, the actual and terrifying new. 

Maybe this meant he’d become what he and so many others had been hired to search for and stomp out, over and over again, within the limitless objectives given to them by the Agency of Data and Detection, which itself was only one of so many agencies of its kind within the M.A.S.S market. 

Maybe he’d possibly become a subversive agent? 

This was not what Jack had ever wanted to be. 

If anything Jack wanted nothing more than for his existence to remain entirely obscure. 

But subversive agents were never obscure. 

The agencies, his world itself, the landscape, wouldn’t allow them to be. 

Or to put this another way, Jack didn’t know very much about his world, but he did know that his professional life shouldn’t at all be like his personal one. There should be a separation. His familial problems had been bad enough to begin with, so there was no reason not to try to whack-a-mole them out of his everyday experience, out of his memoires even, if he could. 

And in this way he was, as he would always be, just like his family. He was (and is) a product of them, after all, and he was like them because he was, and often is, just as incapable of confronting himself as they were and still are. He may have been more capable of observing himself than they were, sure, but in reality, what difference did that make? As any writer, game developer, or storyteller well knows, there is a stark contrast between observing something and confronting it. 

And this was an essential difference, it was maybe even the difference between a static and a dynamic character, if such definitions were worth being established, after all.  

It was why agents such as himself were always expected to remain continuously objective within their work: to observe was to maintain order, and to confront was to change, subvert, and risk spiraling, splitting, into chaos. 

And no, no, no, no, no.  

That would not do. 

It would not do, at all, could not be done, especially not by him. 

He wouldn’t do it, or certainly never intended to do so. 

But here he was, having done it. 

Could there ever have been, could there ever be, a separation between one’s personal and professional life?

“Work-life-balance” was the name for such an acidic idea, and it could easily be found repeating itself incessantly within the idiolectic matrix of many of the agency’s quotidian and continuous training modules, and the achievement of such a balance was never the agency’s responsibility. Of course not. How could it be? A.D.D. didn’t have agency? It was its agents themselves which had agency, or they at least had enough agency that it was their responsibility to achieve such a balance. It was their own personal and individuated struggle to achieve this balance, a responsibility which proved they had agency to begin with, didn’t it? And this meant, just like the job itself—his job being like so many if not all of the others—meant that one could only achieve such a balance if one was to observe rather than to confront, to maintain order rather than to subvert, to remain professional and never personal, to strive for happiness and never its alternative, despite any and all problems or symptoms which may present themselves, no matter what they may or may not be, and of course, none of this had (or continues to have) anything to do with the maintenance and power (or the maintenance of power) of the agency itself (meaning A.D.D. as agency, not Parlance’s own; Parlance hardly had, or hardly has, any agency at all in the matter, as any observer could easily tell), and I, Jacklyn Variance, as the observer of this collection of data and an ADD agent myself, do find it essential, however discouraged it may within A.D.D. protocal, to insert myself here (with the purpose of long-term objectivity) in order to note that none of these observations are being made as intending to suggest anything negative or critical of the agency itself (meaning A.D.D.), whatsoever. None of what has been written, either within this document or within future documents, is intended sarcastically or flippantly in anyway, and therefore, I am trying, by saying so, to make my intentions clear that I am not in any way attempting to insert any sort of subversive actions into this analytic document pertaining to my current subject, Jack Parlance, and I am instead observing his capacity for subversive action, or his much more preferable lack thereof, if any is at all even possible. 

From what I’ve laid out, it should be clear that the system which I ‘ve been discussing in the recent passages of this Analysis Document is quite efficient, the truth of which has nearly become an objective reality itself, an entity, a corporation. Although all observations, since they are always made by individuals (or at least almost always), are nothing if not subjective, so I’ve chosen to insert myself subjectively here in order to make my own objectivity more definitive, as well as my intentions, my objectives. It is not the efficiency or inefficiency of our systems which is in question within this document, but instead, it is Parlance’s individualized, differentiated inefficiency, his inability, yet again, to continue coding his game because more and more he’s realized, or he’s realizing, that there’s an essential part of his game’s story that’s missing: his family. 

Even games can tell narratives and create myths, after all, maybe even automatically so, before we’ve even created them, at least if they’re based on rules that can be followed and recreated, remade, even before their time, structures waiting to animate form, to become form animated, like palaces of cumulative memory. 

What is (and was) missing from Jack’s imagined game was the concept and subject of family, and Jack’s inability to include the concept of family wasn’t only due to his inadequacies as a storyteller, but his inadequacies as a person, personal or professional. 

Jack had abandoned the most essential of all Gibseyan themes: family.

Even if for good and justifiable reasons, what individual is capable of doing so without destroying themselves? 

The magical bonds of family represented a bond so supposedly essential to one’s personal development: attachment. 

Or to put it another way: identification. 

The possibility of both, of either, had now been severed for Jack, maybe even permanently. 

One cannot attach oneself to oneself. 

One must attach oneself to another, to an other. 

What other reason was there to have such a Gibseyan emphasis on family? 

Who in this universe of ours that we created for ourselves, by ourselves, would specifically choose to be alone, and all by one’s choice?

Why else would one of the earliest, arguably most essential of all of the Gibseyan Mystic scriptures, a classic beyond all other classics, among others, why else would it involve that soft, vulnerable Italian deer, Bambino, forced to confront a similarly traumatic horror to Jack’s? What else did it exist to say if it didn’t intend to express the horror of the loss of one’s familial bonds?

And what potent imagery?

The pivotal opening scene begins, when witnessed by a keen observer, listener, or A.D.D. agent, with a centralized image, the dotted growth of spring grass in bloom, as dainty and unprotected as the swirling fuzz of hair on a newborn baby’s head, and oh, how they smell! There’s nothing else like their freshness because there’s nothing more beautifully detached than a new born baby. They are wholly and uniquely without agency. Their own agency must be taught, or if thought about in a slightly different way, must be theatrically reinforced. 

And so the scene starts with those trepid follicles of grass, of grace, symbols of the new, the vulnerable new, not unlike Bambino, so small and innocent, so easily relatable, attachable, so susceptible to audience identification, chomping at the newness of spring. 

“Spring grass!” Bambino blurts out with astonishment, noticing the little feast. 

Funny, I always thought Bambino was a girl, but she isn’t, or wasn’t, or at least wasn’t identified as such in the film, the scripture, the classic. 

At the start of the scene, Bambino is falling in love with spring, and who can help but be entranced by the new, even if one tells oneself one isn’t? And because of this love, Bambino wanders. And in this way, does the scripture imply that it’s Bambino’s wandering that causes her own mother’s death, this wandering itself being a form of detachment, just as spring itself is a form of detachment from winter? 

No, this observation would be an absurdity. 

It’s Bambino’s innocence, even ignorance with which the audience identifies. The audience, be them children or adults—the boundary between the two, especially during this scene, while watching the loss of Bambino’s mother, dissolving—and like all cyclical scriptures or Gibseyan classics, existing beyond time, and what is it to be a child or adult aside from a marker of time? How traumatic to have one’s identity collapse, and so no wonder the brain compensates or confronts?

Audiences can’t help but see themselves in Bambino. 

All are detached and attached, the most detached and the most attached, the neglected and cared for, and even one’s own response to such treatment, or trauma, itself, is arbitrary. 

One can never forget the ever present falling of the snow during such a scene. 

The snow itself is brought to the foreground and arguably becomes the central image of the scene. 

Nothing spreads more than snow. 

Nothing collects itself to itself more, not even Gibsey World. 

Nothing is more collective.

It is the plummeting and accumulation of purity itself, which the spring has come to desecrate. 

Spring, in such a context, is the coming death, the ever present death, here to obliterate the winter just as Bambino’s mother is soon to be obliterated. 

The voices ring out. 

The ringing out of gun fire, the eternal slap of the shot. 

We shoot films like we shoot deer.

To film is to hunt. 

And it is not the camera which has agency, or the hunter’s rifle which snaps winter into sudden wakefulness, which leaves Bambino to forever wander, this time, a wandering much different than the initial wandering caused by the wonder of spring. 

There may not be any agency to be found in such an image. 

Bambino is soon to be left to mutter repeatedly that eternal phrase, “Mother?” within the layers of snow falling, as they push Bambino further and further into the background, making her (or him) more and more distant from the audience as they grow more and more attached to Bambino, and to Bambino's abandonment, the forced abandonment, of course, which is not caused by Bambino’s agency, but a lack thereof, the snow ever falling, that frontal layering of its flurry, the chaos of snow, falling, creating layers within the layers, habitating accumulations of meaning, Bambino’s continued wandering, “Mother,” a singular noun used to pose the plurality of a question, a series of questions, falling, to question, to be questioned, to be forced to question one’s own identification with one’s own mother, not a misidentification, but a disidentification. 

Poor, poor Bambino, fading backward, being pushed not just by the foregrounding snow, but by the liminal darkness of the dead winter trees, columns of age and maturity, here to temporarily dominate the frame and provide emphasis and meaning. 

And what is being emphasized? 

These dark trees are here to replace Bambino. 

Dead, they are still, natural, organic, and ominous. They are objects, here to contrast Bambino as subject, Bambino as subject retreats, is pushed to retreat, all as the audience is retreating within themselves. 

Like all Gibseyan scripture, like all Gibseyan classics, this is something, a scene, which all audience members have experienced before. 

And they will again. 

It is eternal. 

Bambino, both the character and the title of the film, not an uncommon choice in the early scriptures, is the saddest most memorable creature to have ever existed on screen.

What newness of experience, what isolating intimidation to stand before the coming tower, the rising tower, to face the Buck, to stand and be confronted by the fatherland itself, distilled into a singular image. 

“Your mother can’t be with you anymore.” 

And the buck’s phrase is very aptly put.

It would be entirely too easy to accidentally assign blame to the mother, the abandonment. 

Why had she let her own little one wander?

But there is no blame. 

There is no neglect. 

There is no agency. 

There is not even a true absence because the attachment, the essential attachment, was only ever theatre, and all Bambino is being forced to do is to confront the reality of their own eternal separation. 

For Bambino, the fall of his mother (or her mother, as I, Jacklyn Variance, often thought, this reading being justifiable even objectively because as any audience member should know, women can identify with male characters just as males can identify with female ones), their mother, is a falling from life, the beginning of this fall, the inevitable plummeting of innocence, the plummeting of spring, the death that comes with the new. But the newness, our newness, can’t be helped, and neither can Bambino’s. 

If an audience holds Bambino responsible then they have misidentified the character. Their emotional connection to the film has been entirely severed and by choice, the terror of such a scripture, all the animating terror of its liveliness, is killed and made dead. And this would be caused by a conscious choice, conscious choices being nothing if not a sign or symbol of agency, that which Bambino lacks. 

And this is Parlance’s horror, not the scene itself—he hasn’t even seen the film before, bumbling consumer that he is, which the rest of us will be fated to experience and re-experience—but his horror can be posed as a question, this time, formed from much, much more than a singular noun. 

Who would choose to abandon their own mother?

Jack Parlance would and did. 

He has and still is, at least according to his family. 

This made him some kind of monster, didn’t it? 

Or into one?

He’d done it all, and he’d done it to himself. 

No Gibseyan film has ever existed that isn’t about family. 

To wander from such a subject was to wander to one’s own death. 

Family was Gibsey. 

And Gibsey was family. 

It was like an agency in this way, a theatrical role. 

He’d soiled the sacredness of his work-life balance. 

Family colonized both the mind and body, the personal and the public, let alone the spirit. 

It animated all things, was in all things, endured all things. 

And as such, what would his remake of Bambino be like?

Parlance, the remake’s title. 

Spring grass falls across the foreground of the frame. 

Close up of a patch of ice appearing, seemingly, out of nowhere. 

This is not a forward moving of time.

This is a cycle in reverse, a movement backwards, a backward movement, a backyard, a retreat. 

But a retreat from what? 

From conflict itself? 

Wouldn’t that itself be a conflict?

Unlike Bambino, he isn’t entranced by the ice. 

Having to see the ice is a tragedy. 

It is the death of the winter to come. 

All remakes, like all families, however separate, repetitious, or original their adaptations, cannot help but contain traces of the original film. 

Or memory. 

And in this way, they’re haunted by them.

Memories. 

We are all haunted, horrifyingly haunted, fated to wander. 

We accumulate ghosts like the falling of spring grass. 

We become ghosts, livers of life in reverse, falling. 

We haunt others, just as Parlance is haunted by his own family. 

He is (or was) conflicted about the thought, originally mentioned, his realization of the absence of family from the story of his game, and is conflicted about it because he knows to do so, to construct such a narrative, would be too much for him, will be too much. It may even be too difficult to remember them ever again. 

He would rather forget. 

He will choose to forget and already has. 

It is too upsetting to even remember them. 

This, above all, proves his own agency, fault, blame, and guilt. 

It was almost as if he lived in a world where laws themselves had been made illegal, so to be innocent, and to claim one’s innocence, was to admit guilt and condemn oneself, because to claim innocence was to assume that such laws existed, to become guilty by default, a garden of good and evil, like a tyranny of choice, or like a chalice of ice melting in a green, spring meadow, waiting for someone to come upon it, to experience that eternal shock of the new, a newness itself to contrast against the newness and blankness of a dull, expected spring, a small patch of ice that could only ever melt. 

There was no salvation for him. 

He’d chosen damnation. 

And he’d done it to himself.

And his family had agreed. 

All of them, every single one of them, had agreed.

But he also knew how powerful it would be for whatever story he told to include the bonds of his family, details which would be the heart of the story of whatever game he’d later create: how his mother would often sing them awake in the mornings (and how classically Gibseyan was that?), the sound of his father’s laugh, a laugh which happened often, the way it revved up and ignited like a lawn mower engine being pulled into life, their liveliness, or their strangeness, their relationship to time, which he’d first fully noticed when they’d shown some videos they’d kept of their lives before having children, before the fall, on VHS tapes, together, early in their marriage, before the weariness of responsibility had taken hold, and these images had transfixed him. He could watch them forever, he felt, even at such a young age, because they were a record of their now dead youthfulness, their newness, a youthfulness he’d never ever seen within them before, that he’d never been given the chance to see, yet here it was, with all the dotted grain and nostalgia of its context along with it, the color palette of the past itself seeming different than his present, and it was a past that could never be recreated. Its colors were a set of colors, a series of colors, that radiated with a now faded authenticity, as did his parents, and his grandparents, and their friends that came in and out of the various ever-changing shots and locations, friends of theirs, most of whom he’d never met, which his parents had even commented on upon first showing the old footage to him—he doesn’t remember if the video images had been digital or physical, he grew up in a period between material and digital forms (or spiritual? Wait, did this mean that digitization was a spiritualization, a theater, a haunting, like the images that had transfixed him also were?)— saying things like, “That’s Sammy. God, we haven’t spoken to him in years,” “Ah, Melinda, what a sweet girl. I wonder whatever happened to her?” Or, “Oh, look, that’s Ben Kneeman. He was very close with your grandfather,” none of which he’d had any context for, but it was the lack of context, the fact that they’d existed well before him, without him and his siblings, as their only context, this was what had ignited him with hope and revelation. He didn’t feel jealous or insecure finding this record of their life without him. If anything, it made him feel more connected to them. 

They’d been just like him. 

They’d been happy. 

This was an alternative to what life would be like.

One could be happy!

It was clear, this was what would happen to all parents, on some level. 

Their exhaustion, the weight of their current lives was inevitable and couldn’t be helped. He knew that, could sense it, and deeply. He just hadn’t yet seen the alternative. Hadn’t even contemplated its existence. And here it was in all of its radiant glory. 

And it had made him want to become a parent one day. 

It made him want to give his own child the same radiant self-awareness: to see himself within another and to see them within himself, to connect, to identify. 

Parlance. 

His parents had lost something, as Bambino had, an innocence, but what he’d never realized before, and what he realized then, was that this loss assumed a connection, that a period of liberation, however brief, had once existed, and that he himself could, now that he recognized it, attempt to recreate such a period of liberation, if he wasn’t even already experiencing it, repeating it, reflecting it, then, within the purity and newness of his innocence. 

But he was no longer experiencing it. 

One need not have children to lose such an innocence. 

Anything at all could cause it to be lost.

The cause was not what mattered, but the effect, its universal sustainability. 

And the images, those old videos, were like the memories he could no longer conjure up as inspiration for the game, despite even his knowledge of their power. 

And there were so many. 

Too many to name, let alone further identify. 

None of this has even begun to mention his siblings. 

He was the youngest of four. 

His oldest sister, Brandi, sitting atop her white, wicker desk, staring at the framed photo of a violin surrounded in rose petals she’d hung on her wall; he’d always been told that he was her favorite. She seemed to feel less competitive with him than the others, more paternal. 

And his brother Brayden, his many pranks and jokes—which he himself later lost the motivation to continue due to the weight of passing time—most of which had been harmless; he was notorious for mooning them constantly, for dropping his pants at the drop of a hat, even at the most inappropriate of times, even going so far as to draw images on his ass in preparation for the various act (smiley faces, Xs, you name it, and how had he even done so, on his own ass?) for its random recipient to bare witness.

And there was his sister Jennifer, 7 years away from him and closest to him in age, she’d affected him deeply, had shown him so much about what being alive would be like, for good or ill, represented so much of its best and worst possibilities, all he would want to either maintain or subvert, the hundreds of boardgames, the vacations and trips, putting on a raincoat to disguise himself and burst into the room while she was hanging with a group of her friends, and he’d been so disguised, so how could she’ve identified that it was him?

But despite whatever memories he couldn’t even conjure any longer, they’d all, in his mind, been just as culpable in his inevitable retreat. 

He was the youngest, so his position as observer rather than participant had existed from the very beginning. To him, all he’d done was share his observations, but to his parents and siblings, his observations implied a confrontation, and they did not agree at all with what he was asking them to confront. 

He hadn’t understood this. 

There was no confrontation that he was aware of? 

How could there be?

He was a part of whatever he was observing?

He’d tried to explain this to them again and again. 

He was a part of the family, was formed by it, had been brought into existence by it, and all he’d wanted to do was help them to be happy like they’d been before, to help them return to what he’d once seen, to ease the pain and horror of their seeming denial. He hadn’t spoken of anything they weren’t already aware of, or which they’d denied was real. What they’d denied was a willingness to listen to the observation to begin with. 

They’d chosen not to identify. 

The beginning of the end was when his siblings came to the decision to longer speak to him individually. It would be discussed as a whole family, or it wouldn’t be discussed at all.

This provided no room, no possibility, for intimacy. 

This move was, according to his siblings anyway, to preserve the family. 

But he knew what it meant. 

As a group, the family would continue to preserve itself, and this meant that nothing but public humiliation and shame was left for him to endure. 

And thus, he’d become a sacrificial lamb. 

Or deer.  

Either nothing would happen at all, or an example would be made of him. 

And this was the worst of all possible outcomes. 

Even their individual discussions had fractured into the trauma of nightmare, of mis-dis-and-ex-communication, the kind of nightmare where the subject, who is almost always yourself (but not always), tries to speak, is desperately trying to speak, only to find their voice silenced, stolen by some unknown entity, physically, mentally, or in some other more dreamlike capacity. 

The exact content under discussion didn’t matter, it never does, what matters is the force of the nightmare, its effect, which frightens you awake, but Jack is now awake without any dreams to wake up from into any alternative reality, or at least not that he has found or yet been made aware of. 

And so he’s come to believe himself as excommunicated, and maybe he even has been. Evidence didn’t point to any of his observations being embraced in such an environment. 

Like the content of any given dream, the root of the Parlance family’s dysfunction, what Jack had identified, didn’t really matter. It could have been ideological differences, differences of a political or religious origin, his sexual orientation, or his choice of gender, or his views on sexual orientation or gender, or none of these things, and anything else. The content didn’t matter. What mattered was the denial, the lack of identification, of whatever he’d brought to them, the effect. Miscommunication had transformed to an unspoken ex-communication, which led to Jack speaking and conjuring his own ex-communication into existence, all of it in some search for some kind of agency, and all of it had now left him not knowing how to write his family, or even the concept of family itself, into the game he’d hoped to code, but which he was never even coding. 

Another of his many repeated failures. 

But both like and unlike The Biggest Shit of All Time, a coming attraction later to be unearthed from the Gibseyan vault, upon reflecting, or upon reflection, he’d found a solution. 

It came to him outside of liminal time, at work, mid-morning, the home and shelter of his corporate clattering, chatterering. He could do the dreaded thing every (or at least most) aspiring artists are often forced to do—be it filmmaker, writer, painter, video game developer, or any other—embrace the old and focus group tested idea of the cliche. 

He’d kill off his family, metaphorically speaking, of course.

Patricide.

Wasn’t this what had happened to Bambino? Dumpo? Cinderino? Didn’t even Andrea eventually abandon her toys in the classic Toy Narrative franchise? And it was in all of the superhero texts, as well, a terrible familial trauma that’s mirrored by another trauma, the bite of an insect, or an alien or animal or artificially-intelligent origin, or like with the classic CD Comics superhero Lemurman and his parent’s murder, or even UltraPerson’s less violent origin—everything with UltraPerson was always sanitized, more conservatively Gibseyan, if such a thing is possible—and even UltraPerson’s parents weren’t even his own; he’d been adopted as an alien, left there by parents whom he’d never find, no story without such an absence, without the becoming of a ghost, which the stories themselves haunt, time, and wasn’t this all a conservative position? One of conservation? As effective and efficient as any other family or religious order or ideology with all of their endlessly deferred golden ages, or with any of their many nameless, formless, ever-changing enemies to snap one’s synapses into fear and paranoia, even after the said enemy has been vanquished, since it could always return, at any moment, couldn’t it? 

Wasn’t it fated to always haunt them all?

But even “the new” was also haunted, haunted by the loss of itself, or its inability to sustain itself within the collective imagination. The new has (or always had) even become the new haunting, artists and thinkers across the Gibseyan landscape developing newer and newer ways of haunting themselves, or of being haunted, the creation and dispensation of ghosts, no longer the cliche home-pain of nostalgic familiarity, but the wholesale manufacturing of displacement, disembodiment, dismemberment, dissection, and ex-communication. All the refugees and refuges of the entire subversive underground, even it and they were also haunted, even if ultimately, it was they who were haunting themselves. 

Who else could be doing the haunting?

Ghosts aren’t some lonely unknown outsider trying to haunt the living. 

And to think of them as such was to make the same mistake as the Parlance family.

They were always haunting themselves.

Because there was no outside. 

You are always outside. 

Always backyard. 

When we haunt, and we will always haunt, we can only ever haunt ourselves. 

It isn’t our responsibility as much as it’s our own inevitability, our lack of control.

No one is ever haunted that is in control. 

And no one is ever in control. 

We are all outside. 

Especially not Jack Palance, as vulnerable as any Bambino, as displaced and alien as any UltraPerson. 

His first two siblings, like UltraPerson, had been adopted. 

His parents, for years, had wanted children, but were unable to have them. 

Suddenly and accidentally, as often happens when a lack of intention weasels its way in between the spaces of our lives, the unexpected, the new occurred. 

They had two more, two more non-adopted children. 

The adopted children Jennifer and Jack were not unwanted, but their fate hadn’t been initially planned. The un-adopted children, Brandi and Brayden, were initially unwanted, but their fate within the Parlance family had been planned from the very beginning. 

From Jack’s perspective, the Parlane’s did everything they could to make sure Brandi and Brayden never felt out of place. 

They were never othered, nor should they have been. 

If anything, Jack felt they may have even overcompensated a bit, an occurrence which he also understood and supported. This was certainly better than the alternative wasn’t it? To be made even stranger within a strange land, to be rejected only to be faced with further rejection. Even Gibseyan films didn’t paper over such traumatic and unfamiliar territory. 

But this was why Jack had felt so alien. 

He’d become, not a stranger in a strange land, but a stranger in a familiar land, a stranger to the familial, again they’d overcorrected, overcorrection or undercorrection being the inevitability of all parenting, after all. (It is a horrifying and traumatic business both the constructor of this document and Jack Parlance wouldn’t wish on even their worst enemies). 

Like Gibsey manufactures fantasy, parenting manufactures a complete and total lack of control. 

The word for it is vulnerability, or another, love, if there was (or is) a difference between the two. 

One has to wonder if they have a reciprocal, borderline identical relationship to one another Gibsey and fantasy, parenting and control, but then again, maybe also—

To return to Parlance—Jack, that is—that stranger in a familiar land, that Joseph wandering in Egypt, recognizing his brothers without their own recognition, this time without the final reveal, the prodigal returned, only to be turned away. And the Parlances were deep believers, at that, such deep believers that no doubt could be tolerated, the ultimate threat to belief itself, a reformation in reverse, a response, a symptom, an over-reaction. 

To reform was not to transform. 

After all, even revolutions involved a return to an original state. 

What the Parlance family, including Jack, himself being a Parlance, and who would always be a Parlance, seemed (or seems) to misunderstand is that any remake would always contain traces of the original, and as a result, would always be haunted. 

There was no avoiding the haunting. 

Any attempt was to invite further haunting. 

But hauntings themselves, weren’t scary, weren’t some outside terror here to destroy all things.  

They were just somethings which came from other somethings, mishaps, accidents, ironies, magic. 

Fantasies within fantasies within fantasies. 

The most magical place on earth.

He haunts. 

He haunts. 

He haunts.

Report Code: X463-859-0914B

  

The document titled Jack Parlance Who Misses His Family included in the previous Daily Yearly Document Report relates to a number of repeated features found within many sections of the The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey documents, one feature of which that’s important to consider regarding its possible subversive elements, is the repeated use of creative individuals stuck in a process of unfinished and endless development. This narrative structure symbolizes a material reality within the theme park of our civilization, one material example of which is the growing ubiquity of continued training and education within the MASS markets (the Media Analysis State Services departments), a technique now used ubiquitously within agencies like ADD, if not especially within these sorts of agencies.

One no longer reaches a place of stasis, a place where one can rest, a vacation without end where one can be finished, or where one’s work is finally complete. Instead, what is commonly referred to as a “growth mindset” has been infused into the corporate parlance of most agencies. 

It is essential to note that Jack Paralance’s behavior does not reflect an individual of Subversive means. Part of this is his dedication, if not down right addiction, to consuming various types of media throughout the landscapes of the park. As many data-analysts have observed, continued behavior devoted to consumerism is one of the easiest to identify patterns of the non-Subversive individual, and Parlance’s large interest in film-making places him squarely in this category. He is an especially obsessed and avid-watcher of The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, the reality-show-as-film being continually shot and screened at various areas of the park, simultaneously. A recent untitled document has been located which chronicles his attending of such screenings, which will be recreated below for the purposes of this set of Daily Yearly analysis documents.

Text(s) in Question: Untitled

Report Code: X199-575-8124C

  

Jack Parlance sits at small hotel desk at an Economy Room at The Gibsey Ecco Resort.

Notebook on desk. Lamp on. Likely late evening.

Writing.

He seems unaware that the focus of the film has now moved to him sitting in his hotel room apartment, unless his writing is intentional, which it may actually be. He’s a known devotee of the more naturalistic and minimalistic communities dedicated to the ever-screening film, and being a devotee of the film himself, he’s bound to find out sooner or later, depending on how long the focus remains on him, that he’s now become one of its subjects. 

But he may not have time. 

The focus of the film is known to shift about incessantly. 

But he also may already know the focus is on him, right this very moment. 

Either way, his awareness or understanding isn’t clear to the viewer. 

The entire scene may be performative or it may not be, or maybe that’s his point, what he’s trying to convey to the audience. or maybe he doesn’t know anything is happening at all, isn’t thinking about anything, and is just sitting at his hotel desk. Can the audience really know the contents of his mind as he sits there? Or can they maybe even perceive its content better than he can? 

 Freeze framing the image reveals that he’s ironically writing about the film in his notebook as the scene begins. He appears to be off the clock, meaning that he doesn’t seem to be writing or collecting data for ADD at the moment—though this is debatable, as well, since all writing is a form of data collection—and he is instead doing some sort of writing exercise or reflection in his notebook about the movie itself. 

Writing may not be the correct noun or verb to document here, either. 

He is attempting to write, wants to write, but has not yet put pencil to paper and stares at a blank page under what he’s titled and underlined: What is The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsy?. 

Cast Members from the Props department later investigate this notebook of his to find previous entries that suggest his anxiety has increased recently, almost as if he’s subconsciously aware of the coming shift of focus to himself, that his own life would finally, after all these years of being the observer, become one of the observed. 

  

My anxiety’s getting worse. 

It’s in the air. 

I can feel that something is coming. 

But I don’t know what it is. 

It’s like a virus.

Or maybe it could be one.

Already is.  

Another one. 

I’ve become so afraid.

The terror.

Full of so much terror lately. 

Continual terror.

Unable to sleep for very long. 

Coming down with a rash. 

Dizzy spells.

But I don’t think it’s anything serious. 

But it has to be something. 

There’s so much trauma that gets ignored, recreated, and analyzed, nearly every moment. 

Going to see a screening of the movie in a few minutes. 

I’m worried about what I’ll find there. 

Every time I look I see something new. 

The terror isn’t in not finding something. 

It’s in finding too much. 

  

(Exposition is given within the film as a possible window into Parlance’s possible current emotional state that, for now, so early in the patterns of his unfolding, can only be inferred. But to return to the untitled attachment). 

  

Jack Parlance sits at small hotel desk at Economy Room at The Gibsey Ecco Resort.

Notebook on desk. Lamp on. Likely late evening.

Writing. 

He begins to write. 

(One wonders if the audience should be given, through flashback, a recreation of some hint of the previous emotional state, the increased anxiety, mentioned in the previous section since his writing in this section seems instead more focused on Jack’s thoughts on the film itself, or on the park rather than Jack himself, The line between the two in both reality itself and what he’s writing is unclear. This could prove an important detail in the analysis of Parlance’s SUBversive tendencies. A separate notebook entry with the same title What is The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsy? is included below recreated with the original spacing, paragraphing, and syntax built from memory, thus accuracy may be questionable).

  

A film, an amusement park, a space, an idea, a human monument, a landscape of terror and violence, the most magical place on earth, Gibstory, a man made environment, a liminal space, an infinite loop, a reflection, or a moment of

  

Parlance pauses in his writing. This is the moment where it especially seems as if he may be contemplating whether or not he has become the real and current subject of the film. He looks up, lost in thought, playing with the end of his mechanical pencil, screwing it off and on again. Lead accidentally spills out. He gathers it up off the floor and puts it back into the pencil. 

Is this a moment of improvisation? 

How much is he aware of?

He smiles. 

An action such as this seems too obvious not to be an unintentional one, though interviews with other Cast Members familiar with Parlance, in particular, have revealed that he’s known for his absentmindedness, flights of fancy, digressions, insecurity, indecisiveness, a lack of focus and awareness, that he’s unable to stay on any given subject for an extended period of time, that—for example—his being under investigation as a possible SUBversive agent is entirely unknown to him, and many even think it suspicious that he works as a writer and data analyst for A.D.D., let alone that the focus has shifted to him within the film entirely, while the narrative is still unfolding, that he may even be in the process of becoming a major character. 

This has already ignited the social networks, though being constantly unaware of so many things, Jack is unaware of this.

Parlance stops to write the title again, this time not underlined or italicized, and slightly adjusted: What is/are The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey? 

  

Lately, the never ending, continually updated film 

seems to be focused on The Magical Dominion. 

But when will I become a part of the film? 

Have I already? 

  

He stops again, looking up, again, slyly smiling. It may be important to note that this smile may only appear as a smile to a viewer who interprets Parlance as aware of his own awareness. He may not, in fact, be smiling. 

  

I’ll have to find out at a screening. 

It could happen. 

It really could happen this time. 

  

Not to provide extraneous notes aside from the events being observed but this would be a good time to flashback to the previous entry in Parlance’s notebook, or at least its essence or recreation, it’s remake, to a reminder of the events of the screening Parlance is attending later this afternoon, which is coming up very soon–hotel clock does read 10:56 am, despite the fact that Gibstory is dead, and taking the time for bus travel to the Gibsey Summers Shopping Area GMS Theatre Mega-Complex Wonderful Worlds Showcase Screening Theater 16, it’s clear Parlance may be finding out within the hour, not a common occurrence within the film thus far, though it has become increasingly so, a sign that that our world itself may be becoming self-aware, may have signs of some sort of artificial intelligence, or general or extended intelligence, that its data has come to life, that its words have been made flesh, form animated, the environment itself being, or becoming, a living, breathing thing, not just an organization but an organism, a living being, an unfolding narrative, a corporate entity.

Jacklyn Variance lingers, collecting data, notebook in hand, behind Parlance.

Waiting in line for the bus to the Gibsey Summers Shopping Area, always waiting in lines, varicose, clustering crowds, strollers, obnoxious toddlers, the peeling paint of the railings. 

Busses sigh when they reach curbs, and so does this one, images of Dickey Dog and Neptune painted on the side. Park goers enter the threshold of the bus. Seas of t-shirts, heading to Gibsey Summers. 

It is shocking that he’s failed to notice Variance after the hundreds of hours of being followed.

For a writer and collector of data, his skills of observation are rather flawed. 

Variance notices and observes, and never stops observing; Parlance doesn’t even begin to observe, simply takes up space, plops in his seat, slump-shouldered, clicking through links on his phone to ease the subtle boredom of not being in his theater seat immediately.

He’s lost in thought of the hype of the film, the future, the possibility of its meaning, allowing him to hover like a kind of magic carpet ride, like a bus, a transportation system, above himself, temporarily. 

Another bus sigh as it jolts down to the next curb. Bodies pile out and click onward toward their destinations like blood cells rushing to capillaries. Circular and circulatory, he buys himself popcorn and a large drink. 

Indications of his exorbitant spending on the habits of entertainment, at least exorbitant with the context of his salary in comparison to hers—the agent following him doesn’t just best him regarding amount, but where she places said funds, where it’s transported in the body of her financial intentions, the neural pathways she’s carved out for herself; he has no financial intentions other than what he wants then and there at any given moment, and his debts just grow and grow– his ever-growing debts, shackles of commerce, butter and salt, sugary sweetness, images of ice peeling down sides of cups, images colder and more refreshing than the overpriced cardboard you slip into  the circular cup holder to face the light, but he isn’t there yet, she’s still watching him waiting in line, always waiting in line, the piling bodies, the images, the moving images. 

Even though she typically tries to be a passive observer, even she's a bit hyped at what image he’ll find on the screen. 

Will it be himself? Will he have been able to catch himself in time?

She’s busy scribbling down the codes of her correspondence, tracing the symbols of his trajectory into the theater, trying to locate details she’s thus far failed to include —hasn’t even included a physical description—but was that even necessary? Or was it better to dive deeper, to risk the bends, to move ever further under the skin, and to peel back the epidermis to the generalized soft, pinkness of the flesh below? Or better, to spiral out to the specificity of his medium length brown hair, eyes not quite hazel, but definitely somewhere between green and brown, black t-shirt with a series of white stripes that flutter down it in what seems to be an intentionally unorganized pattern, eyes drooped and circled with the darkness of sleeplessness, likely the aforementioned growing anxiety, Parlance, stranded, island of insomnia, not wanting to sleep and with all that content to cram into his cranium to aid him in sweet, sweet avoidance, why not just stay up all night?

The key insight, struggled into existence by the film’s yet-to-be-identified author, was that all the film needed to thrust its audience into a narrative, all any narrative needed to burst forward from the shuttering-click, to swirl into existence from the light of life, was a time and place, the key insight being that all times and places were just that, times and places, times and places to be found, waiting to be known, longing to be known, documented and recorded, skipping beats, scratching records, grooves and edges galore, and so if all you need is a place and time to construct a narrative, and there is no place and time that isn’t a place in time, then there never wasn’t a narrative, not even once; everything was ever in a state of unfolding itself to the world. 

Point the camera, pop the popcorn, crank up the prices, and watch the cash flow in. 

You could even put the cameras in their hands and make them the filmmakers, allowing them to then become both audience and filmmaker, an endless loop, a circulatory system, closed, finalized, and without end.   

But maybe externalities were bound to present themselves within such an arrangement, and Jacklyn Variance is about to notice one, the image of herself coming on screen as Parlance enters the darkness of the theater, walking subtly behind him, to halt in front of the image of herself, to see the image of herself, there in the dark, standing, not to see the image of herself, but watching a different version of herself, not one she remembers, or was it even a different version of herself or her same self? 

Or she considers another possibility, is this some glimpse into a future event?

She’s read many Data Reports on the sensation of deja vu, an anomaly of memory whereby one’s recollection or sensation is centered around some sort of dreamed or not-quite-conscious experience that somehow remains sensed or processed as conscious despite its unconscious origin, defying one’s sense of possibility. And like most experiences, this could happen at any time, at any point in someone’s life, even at a younger age. And this is true, as Jacklyn remembers, if the memory is correct, a time in grade school, staring at her desk, convinced that her pencil was at an angle she’d seen before which existed outside of everyday reality, and her backpack had been there, as well, when she’d seen it, and the sound of her teacher’s voice trailing off about some mathematical idea she suddenly didn’t have the attention for. Why did it strike her with such familiarity? This sensation also could be induced, according to her training, still ongoing, of course, and agents were often encouraged to search out and attempt to consciously repeat this process regularly (if this process was, in fact, induced consciously, data analysts are still divided on the subject). 

The process begins with an observation, any observation, like staring at a screen, or outside a window, or looking into a frame, or even just staring out of one’s own eyes, watching something, anything really. It requires the eye, or the mind’s eye if vision isn’t possible at the time due to mental or medical conditions or aberrations, or requires one to see something outside of oneself or to mistake something as outside themselves. However, this first observation doesn’t involve full awareness of the thing being observed but instead involves a feigned sense of awareness, or a lack of awareness, distractions, lapses, or a distancing of oneself, one could say a separation. Although it might not quite make sense for this unconscious process to be consciously induced, it is, in fact, quite possible, and if anything, we do it all the time. Ever lost your train of thought? Ever started day-dreaming at work while the coffee’s still steaming? Ever fell into a place that wasn’t quite sleeping or waking, but was something else, somewhere else, entirely? There are entire places, such as Gibsey World, dedicated to inducing such states of mind in their viewers. It’s a theme park, after all, a manufacturer of observations and excessive projections. 

But the unconscious element is just the first step. 

After this observation is made—if “made” is even the correct term—a second observation is then necessary of the same material, and conscious awareness of this material is then implemented. The two observations are then combined into something other than their constituent parts, helping the observer, or analyst, to see things within their perceptions that would otherwise be unobtainable to their senses. 

Something Jacklyn knows that very few of her ilk seem to be aware of, or at least most don’t seem consciously aware of just yet, is that data analysis, retrieval, and observation is not factual, or at least certainly isn’t entirely factual, because the “factual” material of one’s observations are only what is taken in during the 2nd part of this process. Subjectivity may be discouraged, and even greatly frowned upon within A.D.D. discourse, but as Jacklyn has begun to reflect, and more and more everyday, this discouragement may not be to thwart or undo this said subjectivity, as is often thought; it may instead be to protect it. It’s A.D.D. policy that the more unconscious one’s 1st observation, and the more aware the 2nd observation, the better. 

And there was one more thing Jacklyn knew which she hadn’t observed in most other agents, or which she at least hadn’t seen just yet, maybe it would always be there, all along once she found it–-it often is, maybe even always is, sitting there, waiting to be found by a willing observer—her key insight being that perception is essential to the experience, at least for any analyst worth their salt, because it’s what animates the observation itself, what makes it uniquely hers, or theirs, and therefore what makes it a truly observed piece of analysis. Anyone can observe facts, list data, and repeat information. The agency has machines, clones, and intelligences of both artificial and extended means, as well as a few types yet-to-be-named since they’re still in the process of their own development, all dedicated to collecting factual data of this kind at an increasingly rapid rate, feeding it back into itself, and multiplying. This was a theme park civilization built on the shoulders of the American empire, after all, shoulders that had been buckled down by the size and weight of all that had been collected from the very beginning. No, what they need, or needed, what the essential and competent analyst must always attempt, is to perceive, and upon perceiving, they would then transform the environment of their world. 

If every time and place is already and will always be a time and place, and therefore represents a narrative always in the process of unfolding, one could change this narrative, one’s narrative, through this method of adjusting one’s perception, but even then, this form of data collection was a dangerous kind, maybe even the most dangerous kind. It being based on one’s individual perceptions, there was no ongoing training for how to implement and maintain such approaches, no customer service, no cast members to assist, no map. 

Its threshold had to be entered into, alone. 

You see something without seeing it, and then you look again, and so a splitting is involved. 

And as Jacklyn stands, uncharacteristically frozen in the darkness of the theater, a memory comes to her mind. 

His name was Preston. 

They were never romantically involved, but they were deeply interlinked somehow, something beyond even perception, something yet to be named because it was still in the process of its own development. 

It’d happened to him at such a younger age than anyone would ever be able to understand. 

The phone call, cradling the phone in her hand, late that Tuesday evening. 

“It’s Preston.” 

But this wasn’t Preston’s voice on the other line.

It was someone who knew Preston calling to tell her something she wouldn’t understand, which would take her a very long time to understand, that she may never consciously be able to understand.

The most powerful forces, the truly powerful forces, are the ones which escape all perceptions entirely, and if anything, this was why the process of maintaining one’s perception was so important, to keep these forces at bay. If someone wasn’t watching, who knew what chaos could be unleashed and run amok? 

Was there anything more indicative of the process of observing than grief itself? 

She never saw it coming. 

Sometimes you do, but not often. 

Certainly not with Preston. 

It didn’t have a reason. 

Reasons for something such as this would be insulting to reason itself. 

It just happened. 

Sometimes, it just happens.

She finds herself seated in church pews, later at picnic tables, trying to eat cupcakes but not even able to take a bite, and later, crying heavily, alone, driving to work, trying to pull herself together. 

How had it happened? 

How could she have been so careless in her perceptions? 

Was there something she could have seen?

Some piece of data trapped in her memories that could unlock it all, that could help her go back, to transform the past that led up to this moment?

Did that also come down to perception?

Preston was a filmmaker, notorious for never completing any of the projects he’d wanted to complete. 

His entire existence was a cutting room floor, so much so that he never got around to making the masterpieces everyone knew that he could’ve made.

If he had, the world itself wouldn’t have known what hit it. 

Nothing could have prepared it.

Nothing. 

 And of course, that’s why it'd been so hard for him to finish and so hard for everyone else knowing what would now forever be fated to be withheld from their world.

Days before, she’d talked to him on the phone quite a bit actually, a little bit more than normal, but not in any sort of way that seemed out of the ordinary. They talked on the phone quite often, after all, so she hadn’t thought it out of the ordinary.

How could she have known?

Did she? 

Did Preston? 

Of the many details, the data, the facts observed secondarily, which she remembers constantly and repetitively now, from those talks, the most important detail, or the one which has stuck with her the most, was the title of a film Preston said he’d wanted to make. 

“Splitter.”

He drank often, and was drinking then. She’s pretty sure he’d burped loudly at this part of the conversation, but this detail wasn’t gross or off-putting for Preston, it was part of his natural charm, jovial as Dionysius and agile as Hermes. He just couldn’t see it in himself, hadn’t yet made the 2nd observation, and arguably, maybe it’s best not to in many cases, but with Preston, they all knew, if anyone should have seen it, or was deserving of being seen, it was him.

But the thing about Preston, however cheesy or Gibseyan it may sound, was that he didn’t observe himself because he was truly, unflinchingly always seeing so much in other people, so much outside himself. 

And all he did was see. 

He was a man of vision, one could say.

“Do you know what a Splitter is?” He’d said to her.

She didn’t know, hadn’t known. She was seated in her yellow armchair, given to her from her grandmother. Her place a mess, deep into the more insecure, early period of her work, chatterering, gnawing frivolity. 

What could she have done?

“You know that thing you have to plug your headphones into? Before bluetooth, when we used to, ya know, and if you wanted this chord—it’s this thing that gives you 2 headphone jacks at once. So what it is—you plug in the input into the output of what you want to listen to, and then it gives you two further output channels that you can plug into. Does that make sense?  I feel like I’m explaining it poorly. It’s about connection, really, and how it’s a self-creating process, automatic.” 

“What? The movie?” It’s late, but talking to Preston does usually get her in touch with a side of herself she doesn’t get to see very often, the side where she can finally give herself a damn break for once, and so she needs a drink, wants one, and goes to the kitchen and makes one for herself. Phone in hand, against her ear, she drinks and wanders the tile of the kitchen floor like a labyrinth. They continue talking and she traces the lines of the squares, trying to stay focused on Preston’s accumulations. 

“Yeah. It’s about establishing a form of communication between people struggling to communicate.” He’d mentioned this plot to her before, but she can’t remember it, can’t place it. How had this been enough material to center a whole movie around, a type of headphone jack? It hadn’t made sense at the time, but she kept coming back to it, observing and re-observing the title, not understanding what it meant. 

Splitter had other definitions she would later look into, as well. 

A split, a breaking into parts, a division. 

Or to share with another.

Strange how it meant both things at the same time.

The process of bringing about fission within an atom, fission being the division of an entity into two or more parts and the regeneration of those parts to separate entities resembling the original.  

To issue new shares (of stock) to existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings. 

To end a marriage or an emotional or working relationship. 

(Of one’s head) to suffer a great headache. 

To betray the secrets of and inform on somebody (and if A.D.D. was known for anything this was it!). 

Splitten, the word of its origin, the landscape of its birthplace, Middle Dutch, late 16th century, referring to the breaking up of a ship. 

But what about a splitter in particular?

That was the exact title of the movie he’d mentioned wasn’t it?

A person or thing designated for splitting something. 

A person, especially a taxonomist, who attaches more importance to differences than similarities in classification.

And what the hell was taxonomy again?

A branch of science concerned with classification, such as the classification of organisms, though it can also be used to create an index of knowledge stored as documents, articles, videos, records of data,  so that users can access information more readily. 

But what about Preston’s explanation, the headphone jack image? What did it have to do with anything?

A device with two electrical plugs that plugs into an electrical outlet, converting the outlet into a two-outlet converter. 

That was a much better description than what he’d initially given.

There was something vague about Preston’s mother, in their previous discussions which she couldn’t place, related to the story. She did remember their relationship, the disconnection, how strained it had become, how he’d cut off contact but had recently tried to rekindle the relationship, how she’d identified with him then, and Parlance later, cutting off her own family, herself, years later, splitting, away from it all, and here it was, in the dark, the connection, as she watches herself splitting in two, forming two separate outputs out of the single input, the energies coalescing, she realizes, somehow intuits, that this isn’t the time where she’ll be consciously aware of what’s happening. 

This is the first observation.

To split is to leave a place, especially to suddenly leave a place. 

There’s an eternal rule in script writing, according to Preston’s training, what’s called the “bomb rule,” where a filmmaker or storyteller places a bomb—some sort of object, tailsman, or image within the scene which the audience is aware of but which the characters are not—and so the audience, Jack Paralnce, still in the audience at this point, still watching the screened images of the infinitely being filmed and screened, all at the same time, The Wondeful Worlds of Gibsey, at the GMS Gibsey Summers Wonder Worlds Megaplex Theater, and watches the jump cut, the figure on screen no longer a separate Variance, but a splitting together, back into herself, as she runs from the theater at the terror of seeing herself on screen, and the bomb rule also applying here, to Parlance, since he’s totally unaware that the figure on screen he’s watching, at the beginning of the film, is a figure who’s been observing him all this time, his secret handler, and that this is one of the only times in weeks, months, maybe even years, that she’s taken her eyes off a given objective to retreat within herself, the cocoon of the self where he’s always had the privilege to live and wander though, but together, their shared struggle, their culture on the attack whether they retreat inward or outward—they are always the ones to blame, blaming each other and themselves, and never the landscape itself that’s formed them—leaving them no solution, the only solution to which is to sit in the darkness of the theater, enveloped in light, not even realizing the theatre where you sit is now the theatre where you watch the person who’s been watching you, to let it pour over you like water into a container, to watch and observe the other you’re conditioned to identify with film after film after film, no matter the quality or content, mistaking this figure like Jacklyn, as someone you know whom you know nothing about, may never know anything about, although you were always this other all the time yourself, retreating from yourself, until—temporarily—now. 

Jacklyn, as you disappear down the heavily air conditioned hallways of the movie theater and pass the posters framed in globular bulbs, cutting to a split-screen shot, Shot A, on the left as you hurdle toward the door, Shot B on the right, as you thrust it open into the sunlight, nothing more fresh than those beams of sunlight that slash you in two when you push open the theater exit door, Jacklyn, Jacklyn—I need you to know: your ever wavering competence, your persistence of vision, Jacklyn, I’ve seen it.

I’ve seen you. 

I’m watching. 

I’ve observed you.

Many, many more times than twice.

So many times.

I’ve always tried to watch.

I can’t help but watch you. 

And who could help but watch?

All I have is time. 

All we have together is time.

When you need me, I will be there. 

I am with you. 

I will do what I can. 

You will one day understand. 

You will one day see. 

You are held within a revolving orbit, like Gibstory itself, rhyming with itself, yourself. 

The edges of your strip of film push past their frames. 

And the film, its focus ever selective, arbitrary, its forced perspective, its perception, is to shift to another character, containing the future within itself, but before it does–

You’ve felt death, Jacklyn, I’ve seen it happen. 

You’ve been handed its cardboard gauntlet of soda, flat, the ice melted, the carbonation long since gone, so many times.

Into your shaking hands. 

So committed to your work and your ever-present need to escape from a reality that never needed escaping from to begin with, the “bomb rule”, longing so deeply to exist somewhere other than the landscape you reside in, that you may as well have already died, but somehow, you live. 

Wishing it was you instead of Preston. 

Cliche as a Gibsey film. 

The trailer of coming attractions. 

But this time, it’s feel-good entertainment. 

A popcorn flick.

The return of a classic. 

A remake. 

Infinitely screening in the preserved-by-the-fact-that-they're-now-landmarks landmark theaters

The music swells. 

A theme, already heard previously in the film, repeats.

A refrain.

The images, when they come on screen, fill you with so much; the screen evokes so much. 

Nothing like placing your heart on your sleeve as you sit there in awe before the images.  
And you watch yourself, finding yourself again in the theater. 

I’ve seen you do it so many times.

I’ve seen the tears peeking out of your eyes.

And I’ve seen you rub at them, pretending that they were an itch. 

But I know. 

I saw you. 

You're so beautiful, Variance. 

And you don’t even see that you are, so hardly are you given the chance to see yourself because you’re always looking.

And it’s this lack of awareness itself that animates you. 

Though again, the film, the remake coming on screen. 

The remake. 

Your partner lays in the grass.

And you lay down next to them.

Your blue hair, the softness of your skin, the dead, digging, dirt below. 

You're truly more content than you've been in a long time. 

The backyard landscape, this backyard landscape, is like a window, is like a screen, it’s like an image that’s laid beneath a frame. 

It’s a hunger. 

You love your dogs. 

Ferris, your half-poodle-half-terrier, comes up to you, now that they're on the same level, ground-level, and he licks your face. Posey, your white schnauzer, sniffs around the backyard, searching for new smells and experiences.

You feel as if you’ve dreamed this all before. 

And maybe you have, or did, or will.

December afternoon. 

A pale sky, ringlets of tree branches staggering in fractal play. 

You shiver. 

It’s cold out, colder than you’re used to. 

Bundled up, rain on the streets, though it’s no longer raining now. 

A light fog. 

Not a day has passed where you haven’t thought of him. 

You see him in the shirts still hanging in your closet. 

In the baseball glove, the novelty joke check he wrote you when you were little, a million dollars–-you had so little money growing up—a pair of his glasses in a slip case, and many more objects than this, more you’d like not to think about for now, but which you’ve placed in boxes which you and your partner move every time you relocate to a new apartment or house, and you hold a few of them every time you do, every few years, you get a chance to hold them again. 

They evoke more than any screen ever could and will. 

They are what all the screens are always attempting to illuminate 

And I see you. 

I see you illuminating within them. 

I watch you. 

Jacklyn Variance, it’s ok when you’re not watching. 

It’s ok that you didn’t always watch. 

Who can? 

And despite my own promises, my attention will also surely wander from time to time, as well. 

I hope you can understand.

Didn’t you know it was outside of your control? 

What you said to them at the end?

All that you weren’t aware of? 

How could you have known? 

I remembered when you told me.

I remember holding you. 

You cried when you told me; you didn’t want to end up like him. 

The hospital. 

Always returning to the hospital. 

He was so lonely. 

All you cared about is that you didn’t want to end up like him. 

You said it over and over again.

So lonely at the end. 

You made that dreaded observation. 

The device he was playing at the hospital with a computer, over and over again, because he had no one else to play with. 

Not your mother or sister or you. 

There was no “happily ever after” then.

Well beyond Gibsey territory at that point.  

Aside from Bambino, he tended to avoid that sort of thing, from what I remember.

But do you remember, years later, married, that trip we took to Gibsey World, blowing so much of the money we should’ve been saving,  Magical Dominion, at the height of our exhaustion in that rotating theater, after all you’d put me through. 

I was so angry with you then. 

But did you lose me?

Have I gone anywhere?

Don’t I wake up with you every single day?

We always get back in line, “The Bomb Rule” refrain.

The audience retains an awareness that the characters lack. 

But is there another form of that same rule?

A change of perception where the characters obtain an awareness that the audience lacks?

A presence within the absence?

Tell me then, Jacklyn, what do you see?

There’s so much to see at any given time.

All you have to do is look. 

And you can’t help but look. 

You’re always looking. 

I’ve seen you. 

I’ve watched you.

I’ve—**
