"I had an inkling that you'd get confused easily. But please be patient with me, darling. I told you I had a theory, but you can't just expect me to magically transfer that idea into that little brain of yours, now, can you?"

"OK, go ahead. I just don't see how this all connects."

"Well that's the interesting thing, dear. Even the smallest connections can make quite a big bang, as they say. What Carl Jung called Synchronicities. Everyone's so afraid of that word nowadays, think it's insane to believe that anything's connected to anything else at all, that one should only ever make objective connections, but that's the thing about Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions, it's science's version of Synchronicity. The smallest error can have wide ranging consequences. Think of the Butterfly effect, darling. So what this means is that just because you think that the mystical among us would have a small effect, such as Manny Valentines, that doesn't make it so. There are even marginalists in Economics, darling, who believe that even the smallest incremental changes can have wide ranging externalizing effects. Maybe somewhere in this house, this palace of memories, could be the piece of data which could unlock the key of your very case, or could be the initial conditions for which it all depends, as they say. But for you to find such a thing, well, then you have to get organized. And darling, it looks like you've started already!"
