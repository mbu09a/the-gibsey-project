This wouldn't mean, like so many of the supposed "rationalists" amongst us tend to suggest-being the ever-limited absolutists that they are-that an after-life didn't exist, but on the contrary, that such a state of existence was already always interlaced within the structure of life itself. This life after-life was not a procession that would then exist above or below the surfaces of daily livable existence only to be descended upon or ascended away from. Instead, it existed in the spaces between things much like the fairies once had, or still do, or much like the spaces which separate words from one another, or like how, throughout the coursing stream of this trembling scene, Glyph finds himself somehow able to wander through the emptied lobby of The Even Grander Floridian Resort while also simultaneously continuing to descend into the next section of the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument ride.
