The most precious detail he wants to get into it somehow, but which he can't figure out how to get in just yet, is a story, an anecdote which he's called "The Biggest Shit of All Time."

It is the story of the funniest thing that's ever happened to him before, and the funniest aspect of the story, for him anyway, was that it was true--it actually happened.

He was at work.

End of the day, that grinding pulse you get in your gut where you just intuitively know it's better to go now rather than suffering with the knowledge of what it is you didn't do for the whole drive back.

And to be clear, this Biggest Shit of All Time wasn't of his own making; he happened upon it by chance. It was just sitting there, waiting to be found by whoever came along to witness its gravity and glory: the biggest shit ever to be found by anyone, ever, throughout all of recorded history.

Before he even first saw it floating in the porcelain tomb of the single-use office restroom, the smell had overwhelmed him.

But he didn't laugh immediately upon seeing it because it wasn't funny immediately.

No, not at all.

There was something terrifying about it, something threatening.
