Especially not Jack Palance, as vulnerable as any Bambino, as displaced and alien as any UltraPerson.

His first two siblings, like UltraPerson, had been adopted.

His parents, for years, had wanted children, but were unable to have them.

Suddenly and accidentally, as often happens when a lack of intention weasels its way in between the spaces of our lives, the unexpected, the new occurred.

They had two more, two more non-adopted children.

The adopted children Jennifer and Jack were not unwanted, but their fate hadn't been initially planned. The un-adopted children, Brandi and Brayden, were initially unwanted, but their fate within the Parlance family had been planned from the very beginning.

From Jack's perspective, the Parlane's did everything they could to make sure Brandi and Brayden never felt out of place.

They were never othered, nor should they have been.
