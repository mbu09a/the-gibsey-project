Hello, hello.

Welcome back.

Yes, OK. I'm going to be a bit rushed today since I was so, let's just say informal, in my previous lecture. I'm going to be purely focusing on the Gibstory, so today will sadly be much less based in dialogue and I will be talking to you through monologue alone, sadly.

Sometimes that's just how it has to be when you've got content to convey and there's no other way to convey it.

I'd love to be as digressive and focused on discussion and dialogue as I was in our previous lectures, but we have purposes to attend to, larger purposes, or maybe the purposes of each are of a similar size but the method of accomplishing each is going to force us to handle the Gibstory here a little more typically than we had before.

I'm sure you've heard of the idea of how we should show rather than tell when we convey information to our audiences. Being a student here, you likely had such slogans branded onto your brain at birth, but today will be one of those days where I tell you a Gibstory to show you a few things, the Gibstory of the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad ride, more specifically.

But this Gibstory doesn't start with the ride itself and instead starts, like so many of our Gibsories, within the initial amusement park that inspired our civilization, Gibseyland.
