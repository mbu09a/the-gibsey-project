Jack had abandoned the most essential of all Gibseyan themes: family.

Even if for good and justifiable reasons, what individual is capable of doing so without destroying themselves?

The magical bonds of family represented a bond so supposedly essential to one's personal development: attachment.

Or to put it another way: identification.

The possibility of both, of either, had now been severed for Jack, maybe even permanently.

One cannot attach oneself to oneself.

One must attach oneself to another, to an other.

What other reason was there to have such a Gibseyan emphasis on family?

Who in this universe of ours that we created for ourselves, by ourselves, would specifically choose to be alone, and all by one's choice?

Why else would one of the earliest, arguably most essential of all of the Gibseyan Mystic scriptures, a classic beyond all other classics, among others, why else would it involve that soft, vulnerable Italian deer, Bambino, forced to confront a similarly traumatic horror to Jack's? What else did it exist to say if it didn't intend to express the horror of the loss of one's familial bonds?
