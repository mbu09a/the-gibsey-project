Maybe everyone wonders whether their thoughts are their own.

Maybe everyone questions whether their actions matter.

Maybe everyone doubts whether they exist.

Maybe everyone fears that they're powerless.

Maybe everyone struggles with the problem of agency.

And maybe some people, like Progresso, just hide it better.

Or maybe some people, like Progresso, just accept it better.

Or maybe some people, like Progresso, just don't think about it as much.

Or maybe some people, like Progresso, have learned to live with uncertainty, to act despite doubt, to choose without knowing whether choice is real.

Which brings The Author back to their original insight: maybe agency isn't about having power, but about acting as if you have power.

Maybe agency isn't about being certain, but about choosing despite uncertainty.

Maybe agency isn't about knowing, but about doing.

Maybe agency isn't about being real, but about living as if you're real.

Maybe agency isn't something you discover, but something you create.

Maybe agency isn't something you have, but something you do.

Maybe agency isn't a state of being, but a way of acting.

Maybe agency is a practice.

And maybe The Author can practice it, starting now, starting with this letter, starting with the choice to finish what they've started.
