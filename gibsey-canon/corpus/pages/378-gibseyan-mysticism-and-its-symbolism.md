And as all dreams fade and end, she isn't-or at least doesn't feel-capable of searching out or returning to these fragments of awareness. They only come to her to dissipate. She could never recreate them, especially when recreation now seemed fated to now forever be loosed from her grip.

Her theme park was fated to know nothing but demolition.

Her bridges would collapse, her attractions would lose their once populated traffic, and her scaffolding would twist into a lattice of tangled wires.

There is nothing left for her anymore.

She's become a franchise now, Natalie Weissman LLC, but she isn't the franchise's set of fresh or new releases. She's the forgotten, original films in the series, a shell, a series of lost works, and she will spend the rest of her life waiting to be found, fated to forever process that she likely never will be who she once was again.

It's simply too difficult for Natalie to do things anymore because nothing, any longer, is worth her time, but all she has is time.
