I have an ailment.

It's not easy to explain.

It affects me, but it also doesn't affect me.

Sometimes, I hardly even notice it's there.

While at other times, my ailment can become quite difficult to deal with.

Either way, I live a simple and ordinary life, and because of this, the difficulties that arise from my ailment aren't all that disruptive, at least not most of the time.

I approached a doctor about my ailment.

And was told that as long as it didn't interfere with my life, that it didn't exist.

I found this to be quite an odd thing to tell someone who's come asking about an ailment.

Because I know there's something wrong with me.

And I've always known this to be true.

And yet, the doctor didn't believe me.

But they were wrong.

I know they were wrong.

My ailment has to do with words.

Again, it's not going to be easy for me to explain.
