The entire scene may be performative or it may not be, or maybe that's his point, what he's trying to convey to the audience. or maybe he doesn't know anything is happening at all, isn't thinking about anything, and is just sitting at his hotel desk. Can the audience really know the contents of his mind as he sits there? Or can they maybe even perceive its content better than he can?

Freeze framing the image reveals that he's ironically writing about the film in his notebook as the scene begins. He appears to be off the clock, meaning that he doesn't seem to be writing or collecting data for ADD at the moment-though this is debatable, as well, since all writing is a form of data collection-and he is instead doing some sort of writing exercise or reflection in his notebook about the movie itself.

Writing may not be the correct noun or verb to document here, either.

He is attempting to write, wants to write, but has not yet put pencil to paper and stares at a blank page under what he's titled and underlined: What is The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey?
