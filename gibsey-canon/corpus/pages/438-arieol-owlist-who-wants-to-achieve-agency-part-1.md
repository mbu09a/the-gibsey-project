Now, to be clear dear reader, depending on your POV, context, or reference point, you may or may not have heard this name before within our story, which means, although you may have heard the name Marvin Scrillio before, Jack Parlance hasn't, which would imply that he has (or had) a gift which he is or wasn't aware of, one that was built atop his own ignorance, a gift many of us, or maybe even all of us, may have, at least if one is willing to confront one's own natural abilities, this gift being the gift of precognition.

Or maybe it was instead that Jack had willed Scrillio into existence?

Which would be something else entirely.

And after all, when it comes to cause and effect, who's to say?

Maybe both were the same thing, simply split in two, like a cell seperating?

A process or regeneration.

Replication.

Cloning.

An invasion.

Either way, to make a distinction, Jack's version of Marvin Scrillio was not (or is not) the real Marvin Scrillio that can be found elsewhere. Their resemblance resembles nothing but a coincidence, a happenstance, an accident, unless it wasn't a coincidence, as such, and it very well might not be.

Either way, he remembers that fort very well.
