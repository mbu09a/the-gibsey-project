Phillip's clearly left the door half-open because rather than waiting for him to stand up and open the door himself, a woman walks into the house to greet him.

"Ah, thank goodness someone's here. I do say. Old Valentinas wasn't going to put this place in order himself, and someone had to! And look what you've done with such rigor and gusto!" They look down upon him as he lifts himself to stand and greet them. They continue, "For the pudgy and average-looking every-man you appear to be, the work you've done here is quite inspiring. Look at all you've done within this place! But also darling, whatever have you been doing laying down there on the floor? It's quite damp, after all. Oh, and do tell, what is your name?"

Phillip freezes, letting out an awkward "uh" noise that sounds like a whoopee cushion being stabbed by an ice pick. He loudly gulps, stuck, wishing he was still excavating one of the Moleskins from the blinds instead being interviewed by this intensely quizzical inquirer.

For all he knows this is a crime scene, and he could now be accused of tampering with the scene of the crime.

Sound familiar?
