"Ah, would ya look at that," Arieol adds, "We only have control of time for a limited time, don't we? Sounds flat out thematic to me! This is a theme park, isn't it? But woah there! Woah there, Glyph old buddy. Whatcha so worried about? You look like you're going up like a stick of dynamite!"

Glyph's heart is palpitating like his straddling a bucking bronco that's well above the weight class of the chicken-legged cowboy of his heart, a heart that's trying to prove to "the boys" who are watching him buck in horror from the sideline, knowing all too well that it's already much too late; he's not going to make it.

"Hold on there, little buddy. Didn't I tell ya? Be not afraid, Glyph! I swear to Gibsey. You're not listening to a damn word I'm saying are you? And here I thought words were your thing. Why the hell do you think they named ya what they did for Gibsey's sake. It wasn't just for mindless pleasure! Deeper and darker forces are always at work, lurking, waiting in line, laying in wait, hidden in the words, between the words, waiting for their chance to strike, to make you disappear, once and for all, forever, before you can even anticipate their action, before you even know what's happened. So why worry Glyph? Why worry at all?"
