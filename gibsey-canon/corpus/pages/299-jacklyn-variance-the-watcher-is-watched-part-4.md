There's an eternal rule in script writing, according to Preston's training, what's called the "bomb rule," where a filmmaker or storyteller places a bomb-some sort of object, tailsman, or image within the scene which the audience is aware of but which the characters are not-and so the audience, Jack Paralnce, still in the audience at this point, still watching the screened images of the infinitely being filmed and screened, all at the same time, The Wondeful Worlds of Gibsey, at the GMS Gibsey Summers Wonder Worlds Megaplex Theater, and watches the jump cut, the figure on screen no longer a separate Variance, but a splitting together, back into herself, as she runs from the theater at the terror of seeing herself on screen, and the bomb rule also applying here, to Parlance, since he's totally unaware that the figure on screen he's watching, at the beginning of the film, is a figure who's been observing him all this time, his secret handler, and that this is one of the only times in weeks, months, maybe even years, that she's taken her eyes off a given objective to retreat within herself, the cocoon of the self where he's always had the privilege to live and wander though, but together, their shared struggle, their culture on the attack whether they retreat inward or outward-they are always the ones to blame, blaming each other and themselves, and never the landscape itself that's formed them-leaving them no solution, the only solution to which is to sit in the darkness of the theater, enveloped in light, not even realizing the theatre where you sit is now the theatre where you watch the person who's been watching you, to let it pour over you like water into a container, to watch and observe the other you're conditioned to identify with film after film after film, no matter the quality or content, mistaking this figure like Jacklyn, as someone you know whom you know nothing about, may never know anything about, although you were always this other all the time yourself, retreating from yourself, until-temporarily-now.
