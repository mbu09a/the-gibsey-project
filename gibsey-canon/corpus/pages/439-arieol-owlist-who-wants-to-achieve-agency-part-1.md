The maroon paint peeling, frayed at edge's warmth, peeling like a tongue, the green slide, hot, radiating with summer, other times, holding within itself a crystallization, made of some alkaloid that seemed compact and full of more molecules than the average material, whatever that means (or meant).

What age does going down a slide stop being fun? When's the exact moment? Or is Jack Parlance just some limp-dicked nihilist fingering his childhood's end? Eeek! He doesn't like that image. Is it something about this machine he's typing on that's bringing it out of him? Without it, would he never have even had the thought?

Maybe slides stop being fun when you realize how things can mean more than one thing at once?

Oh, how trite, you stupid, stupid asshole.

Well, no, try it.

Even trash cans can have a memorable odor.

Speaking of, oh Gibsey, whenever he'd have to take it out every week, back in his childhood, back when he had to carry it around to the yard and not just outside his apartment like he did now. How disgusting it had been, times when it'd be all watery and sickening.

Yuck!
