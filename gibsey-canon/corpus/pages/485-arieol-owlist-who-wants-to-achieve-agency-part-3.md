Suffering.

It's a part of life.

Sometimes you need support.

And sometimes, you make the support you need because you aren't given it.

And sometimes you can't even do that.

But this card, well, it's not about that.

It's about balance.

How we should, uh, Oh Gibsey, how we should make sure to shore up our support for those that need it, even when it isn't being asked for.

Well isn't that just a great little karmic reminder!

But would-ya-look-at-this.

Parlance stops typing.

Jack Parlance stops their typing, there, still on the bench. and looks up.

He looks up, not to see the boil-which he doesn't, if it's even there-but to see the figure on their knees in tears before him with a look of total desperation and insanity etched across their face (meaning, Arieol's) a look of such desperation and horrified gloom and annihilation that even someone as aloof as Parlance knows that something is very much not OK right now.
