She's certainly entered the memory palace often enough to at least trust its authenticity, though she is never entirely sure or certain.

It doesn't comfort her to do this.

Nor does it make her feel worse.

She recognizes, the original Natalie Weissman recognizes, has begun to recognize that she can't help but fall into them, and remember them.

They make no difference to her life and never will.

Nothing can make a difference within her life anymore because it is now her time to wait, to continually wait, for it all to continually end.

And she repeats these recitations of her recent lectures-or her representative's lectures--to herself, so often, she becomes unable to remember or distinguish if what she's recalling is part of her original lectures, the ones she herself engaged in before the procedure when she'd first developed the course or whether they were drawn from the newer cloned version of herself who's now subsumed her social and professional life entirely. She comes to the conclusion upon realizing this -at least when she's in a good mood-that the difference between the two might not even always matter.

But this thought doesn't last long, and never lasts long.
