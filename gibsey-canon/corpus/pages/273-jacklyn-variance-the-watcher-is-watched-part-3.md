It is essential to note that Jack Paralance's behavior does not reflect an individual of Subversive means. Part of this is his dedication, if not down right addiction, to consuming various types of media throughout the landscapes of the park. As many data-analysts have observed, continued behavior devoted to consumerism is one of the easiest to identify patterns of the non-Subversive individual, and Parlance's large interest in film-making places him squarely in this category. He is an especially obsessed and avid-watcher of The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, the reality-show-as-film being continually shot and screened at various areas of the park, simultaneously. A recent untitled document has been located which chronicles his attending of such screenings, which will be recreated below for the purposes of this set of Daily Yearly analysis documents.
