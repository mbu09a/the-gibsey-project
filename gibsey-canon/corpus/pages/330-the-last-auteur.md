A cast member pretends to be asleep, and they wake up and confront another cast member that's standing over them. Each is acting comically annoyed with one another. Oh, and remember, this wasn't the order they shot it in, mind you. I'm just putting it in order for you, so you get the idea of the theme song, the opening credits of the park, really, to make note of it, Arieol, for the script:

Good mornin', Good mornin' Please don't keep me up at night. Good mornin', Good mornin', alright? Alright, alright, alright!

Good mornin', Good mornin' Please let me sleep. Gibsey, I'm nearly through. Good morning, good morning, to you.

Shooting this once?

Shooting it a few times?

That's not how the fucking last-aueteur Marvin Scrillio does things.

Stanley Kubrick on fucking acid is how I'd describe this directoral process of his.
