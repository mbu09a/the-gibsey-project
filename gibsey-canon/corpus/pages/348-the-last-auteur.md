The joy, Scrillio's joy, it's gone.

It plummets.

He knows.

And with how he looks, one wonders if it will ever return.

His eyes go blank.

He starts stammering again.

"Um. uh, uh-Oren"

And I cut off his stammering, furious, "What the fuck are you doing to yourself? Look at your fucking self! Can you see yourself? Do you seem like you're at all functional? Does it seem like this set is at all functional? You really think it is?"

And you know what?

That's all I have to say.

That's it.

It's over.

It's already immediately over.

We pause.

We don't say much else to each other.

And we don't have to.

Eternities pass.

Kubrick on acid.
