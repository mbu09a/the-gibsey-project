I'm sure you've heard this rule of the stage: if you drop something on set, you have to immediately make it part of the scene. You have to. That's what you do in theater, and I mean, when they do it perfectly, you can't even tell the difference.

Gibseydamn it, they're good!

It was just so Petey Puff, you know?

But it's clear it wasn't intentional, which you can only tell by being there, Ariel, by being on set, not that that matters because Scrillio's already yelled cut, been yelling it, again and again.

He's freaking the fuck out.

"Does no one believe in the script anymore!?'

I'm really having to hold back my own anger, and it's starting to feel like the crew members are having to do the same, as well, and Scrillio's sensing it too. You can tell, cause he's getting all stammery with each of his new directions.
