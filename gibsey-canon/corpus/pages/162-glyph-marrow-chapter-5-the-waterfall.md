The Author's always nervous when they buy drinks.

They're so fucking nervous all the time.

And this isn't just an act.

It's all fucking real.

Do you believe me?

In terms of identity, they try to claim to be about as independent as an anarchist about most everything else in their damn life, but yeah right. There's something about being at a bar that just makes them feel like an automatic and co-dependent loser, like everyone else will come to that space more comfortable and in their own skin than they'll ever be, more protected from the downpour. They'll all have made it here with their umbrellas, and The Author will never think to bring one.

Their observational skills just weren't developed enough.

It's why they're so excited to conjure the image of Stillman, to bring life into the inanimation of their statue, to kiss the Princess of their life back into life, Snow White-style, so to speak.

Wasn't that what it was all about?

To animate the inanimate?

Where is Stillman, by the way?

They were supposed to make an appearance weren't they?
