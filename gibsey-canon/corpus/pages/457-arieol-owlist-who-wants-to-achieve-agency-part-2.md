And maybe that's what Progresso already knows.

Maybe that's why Progresso doesn't seem to struggle with questions of agency and existence and meaning.

Maybe Progresso has already figured out that the secret isn't to have agency, but to act as if you have agency.

Maybe Progresso has already figured out that the secret isn't to be certain of your existence, but to live as if you exist.

Maybe Progresso has already figured out that the secret isn't to know that your choices matter, but to choose as if they matter.

Maybe Progresso doesn't doubt because he's learned that doubting is less useful than acting.

Maybe Progresso doesn't question because he's learned that questioning is less useful than deciding.

Maybe Progresso doesn't worry about whether he's fictional because he's learned that worrying is less useful than living.

Or maybe Progresso is just different from The Author.

Maybe Progresso is naturally certain where The Author is naturally doubtful.

Maybe Progresso is naturally decisive where The Author is naturally hesitant.

Maybe Progresso is naturally powerful where The Author is naturally powerless.

Or maybe Progresso is fictional too, and his apparent certainty is just part of his character, just part of his story, just part of the role he's been written to play.

Maybe everyone is fictional.

Maybe everyone is a character in someone else's story.

Maybe The Author's struggle with agency isn't unique to them, but universal to everyone.
