Her original self didn't seem capable of doing much at all anymore, not on her own. All she ever seemed to do was recycle her various complaints and paralyzes. Even just the fact that she hadn't read the piece she'd promised to read would likely be crushing for her to hear. There would probably be tears, and she didn't honestly have time or space for that level of inadequacy within her life anymore, and yet, she doesn't stop and go back to her suite at the Ecco Resort. She walks through the now empty lobby of The Modern, toward the apartment room of her original self to knock on the hotel room door.

If anyone hasn't left it's Natalie, the original Natalie.

Nothing could get her out of her hotel room, not even a Tempestuous Storm.

She knocks on the door and pauses before it.

However, unable to face the horror of her original self, the horror of herself, as she hears her cloned self move toward the door, she turns and retreats down the resort's outside stairway, her memory filling with yet another time where she's wronged herself, given the clone which had cloned her the cold shoulder.

She shivers.

And another memory returns.

Her first memory.
