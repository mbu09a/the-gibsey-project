Stilman pauses, collecting his thoughts, analyzing the data.

"We can get this thing moving along if you want. I was expecting you to freak out about the fact that I froze time like old Glyph did. But ain't that like a Shaman or an older sibling to make the mistake first, so that you don't have to be the one to make it. Whole world on his shoulders, that Glyph Marrow, I'm tellin' ya. There's wonder working pow'r in the blood, am I right? It was either an unexpected disappearance or a sacrifice of some kind, and I guess we'll never know for sure which one."

"It's both."

Every grin, every smile, every grimace Arieol has in their many smiles' tome of a fakebook hit, and all at once.

"Sounds to me like you're ready to ride the ride. But be prepared, we're gonna skip right to the end, ya know."

"Really? Ah, man. I was kinda hoping to see The Geyser section, everything that comes after The Third Descent. Last time I rode it I got stuck on the track."

"Oh, no, we're gonna ride it in full, don't worry. It's just going to be withheld from the audience. Who said they have to have their eyes on everything? Bunch of Sauron, Big Brother, ADD, CIA, Gibsey World, all-seeing-eye ass totalitarian wannabes. Write your own damn story mother fuckers. It's a threshold that has to be entered into alone, alright? No spoilers, though please."

The cart lurches forward, and they ride the ride.
