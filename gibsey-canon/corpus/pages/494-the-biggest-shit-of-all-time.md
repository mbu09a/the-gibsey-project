It also hadn't been funny at first because Jack knew that if anyone was waiting outside, or even worse, if anyone walked in through the restroom door, he would then become the doer of the said deed, and with it sitting there, still waiting, unmoving, he didn't have time to waste.

Or would his culture be split in two by the revelation, with him standing there, sealed by a fate which was out of his control?
