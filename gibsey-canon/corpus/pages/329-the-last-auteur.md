These are communication systems we're working with here, Arieol.

Warp and weft.

Nothing here is ever truly enough, is ever going to be enough. There's always going to need to be more of whatever there is.

And think about that, the pressures I'm under as CEO to create that magic that's supposed to be happening all the time here.

And, you see, that's why I said I respect Scrillio so much because of what he's doing, even with the fucking budget, it's very Gibseyan what's he's doing to a certain degree, even though he's on the edge, even though he's losing it, smelling like shit, eyes bulging, the outbursts.

At least he's dreaming as far as he can dream.

I can goddamn respect him for that, Arieol, and he and the DP are still barking at one another about the lenses, quietly of course, since the sound is still rolling, and the scene continues again and again, and the medley continues, repeating itself, a version of a version of the original song having to start back over again. I think the next section of the scene is performed more theatrically than the previous ones-if I'm remembering it correctly--likely due to what's being adapted.
