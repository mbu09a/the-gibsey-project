To assume that Gibseyan Mysticism is above or below Gibstory is an entirely false assumption, and a mistake that many early students to this mystical arts and sciences often make. No, Gibsyean Mysticism is, like all things, inundated with Gibstory, it is cursed by it, blessed by it, brought forth into it, even through it, and it does also remain in tension with and conversation with it.

It may appear singular, but it is not, nor can it ever be.

It is a dialogue, a dialogue which forms a multiplicity.

I mention this because it is a similar misunderstanding that can happen upon applying either traditional or progressive lenses to Gibseyan Mysticism, which again, provides a stirring reminder of how important it is not to take an "either/or" approach within our mystical work together. My goal within this course is to show you that a "both/and" approach is possible, so that you, on your own, can discover your own mysteries, mysteries that may even show you that a "neither/nor" position may, in fact, be possible, the true and ultimate irony of all ironies, that this may even be an inevitable part of the process, one which is out of your control.

Like I mentioned previously, there has always been this tension within Gibseyan Mysticism between itself and Gibstory, between religious mysticism and religious dogma, between revolution and tradition, and if we are to understand this tension, we may want to establish certain rhetorical definitions, moving forward, of what a mystic, or a mystical experience, actually is within Mystical Gibsyanity.
