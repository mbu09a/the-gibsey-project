They don't remember that exercises can be connected, combined, that all art, any form of it, is a series of interconnected images, exercises, a set of interconnected landscapes, performances, arbitrary choices and connections made within a particular place and time, or given to them, found at a particular place in time, like beginning in a backyard, any backyard, any name or identity to be selected among an infinite set of possibilities.

They think of a cliche situation they've experienced so many times before, some assumptive friend or family member standing next to them in front of some painting in some museum, some landscape, or at least a form of a landscape, saying something like that eternally repeated phrase: "I could have done that."

And they're right.

They could have.

And they did.

The Author doesn't want to say it to them at the time, doesn't want to repeat that oft repeated reply, "But you didn't, did you?"

Because who can even say they didn't?

Didn't they observe the landscape?

What they want to say-or what they wanted to say-is that it's the unique connections made across time and space, which are still in the process of being made, becoming, and the connections between these connections, repeated, fragmented, the chords of these connections tangling and criss-crossing over themselves, multiplying themselves, that is what gives the landscapes their meaning.

They wanted to say this, at least at the time they wanted to say this.

But they never did.

They never do.

They forget.

And they're still forgetting.

They're always forgetting.
