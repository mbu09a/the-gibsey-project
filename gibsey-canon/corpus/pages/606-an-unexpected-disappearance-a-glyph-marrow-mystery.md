All day he's felt the synesthesia of hands touching him.

Light touches, like he's being enveloped by something or someone.

He even yells out "Stop!" while, thankfully, alone in his office, which terrifies him.

What if he resorts to such an outburst around other people?

Would he soon?

What then?

Where the hell was Glyph Marrow?

What had happened to him?

He boards the Diarail heading for the Magical Dominion.

He exits the transportation system, and finds himself walking at a brisk pace, putting his Magical Band against the sensor, nearly running, wishing he could sprint, but knowing that cast members may get involved if he flat out starts running.

He hurries west toward the Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument Railroad in the Boundaryland area of the park, Glyph's favorite ride. Stillman was actually the one that had purchased an annual pass for Glyph, otherwise the poor sucker wouldn't have been able to afford it.

But would he even be there?

Would he be waiting for him?
