Or maybe it's better to say, the screaming starts and lasts until Oren reaches their throat, and it's true, the special effects aren't entirely inaccurate, after all. When Oren rips Arieol's throat wide open, it does look an awful lot like like the gore of such Gibseyan classics as Alien, even if, within this specific situation, it's the inside cavities of their breathing apparatus which bring air and oxygen to his brain, rather than their chest and rib cage that's been torn open into smithereens, though Oren does get to the chest eventually, tearing it out in pieces, chunk by chunk, fragmentary as they always ever are.

Aren't we all increasingly fragmentary, day after day, just like Oren and Arieol?

Maybe that's enough.

Maybe the point's made.

Has already been made.

Maybe.

But it's never made enough times, is it?

Never can be made enough times.

They'd eat us all whole if they could.

Every last one of us.

And they already do and are, all the fucking time.

But this was all in Arieol's imagination, of course.

Never really happened.

Never!

And they knew that, of course, they knew that.

They tremble.
