Infinite pressure.

And the water gushes out.

It swirls him inside,

Through the door

And drains, casting him alone on his back to heave out water atop the black and white checkered tile floor.

The door has saved him.

But he looks up

To sees a figure standing before him,

Over him.

It is a visage, a figure,

The one and only,

It is Malt Gibsey,

"My words shall be made flesh!"
