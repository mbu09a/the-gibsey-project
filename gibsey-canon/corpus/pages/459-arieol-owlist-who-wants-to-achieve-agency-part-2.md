And so The Author chooses to finish.

They choose to complete this letter.

They choose to send it to Progresso, even though they doubt he'll read it.

They choose to continue their investigation, even though they doubt it will lead to answers.

They choose to assert their agency, even though they doubt they have any.

They choose to exist, even though they doubt their existence.

They choose to be The Author, even though they doubt their authorship.

Because choosing feels better than not choosing.

Because acting feels better than being paralyzed.

Because hoping feels better than despairing.

Because trying feels better than giving up.

Because living feels better than not living, even when living means living with doubt, living with uncertainty, living with the possibility that everything is fictional, everything is predetermined, everything is meaningless.

Because even if everything is meaningless, the experience of meaning can still be created.

Because even if everything is fictional, the experience of reality can still be lived.

Because even if everything is predetermined, the experience of choice can still be felt.

Because even if no one has agency, the experience of agency can still be practiced.

And maybe that's enough.

Maybe the experience is all there is.

Maybe the feeling is all that matters.

Maybe the practice is all we can do.
