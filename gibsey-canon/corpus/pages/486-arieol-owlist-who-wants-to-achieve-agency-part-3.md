"You OK?" Parlance asks, surprised.

"This isn't going how I was expecting it to go at all!" Arieol sobs, balling. baffled.

And thus, in that moment of harrowing intensity, a bond is formed.

Parlance being the lonely-ass person that he is, as well, he's going to meet such desperation head on, and not with the cold shoulder it would normally receive, mind you, but with one of-sorry if the term(s) is/are a little Gibseyan-sisterly (or brotherly) love.

As a coder and writer of sorts, Jack's learned to identify with some of the strangest experiences one can imagine, after all, or hopes to, anyway.

Arieol collapses, sobbing, and Parlance stands up to put a hand on Arieol's shoulder, trying to comfort them, eventually getting them to sit back up.

And they talk for hours.

It'd be unfair to include the specific content of their talk here.

It would thwart the powers of a shape-shifter such as Arieol to fully give this experience shape, of course.

We can't have that happening.

Not that it's the content that matters, anyway, it's the form, the effect, and the effects that caused all this seem pretty clear, don't you think?

But do know that, as a stranger in that moment, Jack is very kind to Arieol about it, which is really sweet of him to do at the time, not knowing Arieol all that well and still comforting them and all.
