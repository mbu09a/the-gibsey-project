And so why does Arieol collapse and shape-shift into Caliban in that grave moment of such intensity and importance? To impotence?

It was maybe even a moment of initiation, a ritual.

It had to've been purposeful, surely, had to've contained some sort of intention?

It had to.

Arieol had to see it that way, upon looking back on what it all represented.

Had to find some level of trust.

It could have all even been directed as theater, terrifying, horrific, much-too-real even beyond hyper-real theater, all crafted by Oren for Arieol's own benefit, and after all, what event isn't initiation or ritual within such a brutish environment? All life becomes a test, within such a state of things, a series of judgments from which there are no appeals. All it takes is a repetition, endless repeti-

It wouldn't be accurate to say that Progresso scoops out Arieol eyeballs one by one like a spoon scraping ice cream from cheap, plastic cups.

Nope, that's not at all what happens.

Oren digs both of his thumbs deep down into the caverns of Arieol's eye sockets, grinding his teeth, leaning down hard to collapse both of them into mush like a hammer to drywall, like the snapping of twigs, like your thumb and pointer finger smooshed together to snap a juicy grape into a hollow tusk of ruptuous puss.

Arieol knows, after this, there's no going back.

They scream.
