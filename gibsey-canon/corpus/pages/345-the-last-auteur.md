He calls it early for the day.

And he spots me.

'Oren Progresso! Ooooooren, you mother fucker!' He yells this, running right for me and embracing me like we're lost lovers reunited, like he's forgotten we're both creators with diametrically opposed interests. He's going to think it was my presence here that did all this, isn't he?

The fucking imbecile.

We did it! We did it! I didn't think we were going to get it for so long. My Gibsey. My Gibsey! Everyone's going to be so relieved!' He's whipping tears from his eyes, Arieol. 'Look, I'm so, so, so, so sorry you had to see me acting like that today. It was all for the art. It really was. They did such a wonderful job, though, didn't they? They all did. They really did. They all did, all the cast members. The whole time, really, wow! How did I not see it before? I-I haven't had a shoot like this in, well, I don't even know how long. I don't know if I ever have!' He holds out his shirt and sniffs himself. 'Uh oh. Oh, my god.' He laughs, 'I smell like shit, don't I? I need to take a shower, huh?'"

He's laughing, jovial, heightened, but I'm growing more and more anxious at this point. The thing is, I can't actually have him succeed here.
