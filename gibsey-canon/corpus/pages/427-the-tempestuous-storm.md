This was one of those moments where she lays there, remembering, meaning that she'd attempted to commit the memory to memory, or tries to commit it to memory, wants to keep remembering it, to flash its light from the lens of her life into the cells of her own making, imprison it (or them) in wonder and aching, only later, forgetting, returning, the sun and the moon oscillating, chimming, spinning, where she remembers her remembering, remembers walking atop the cool cement of a parking lot as a tempestuous storm approaches, trying to remember the images, her imaginings, the sounds of the clanking-

Or wait, was it the sound of wind chimes that she remembered?

Remember?

It was.

Natalie, the original version of herself, had walked in through the sliding balcony door, the wind chimes chiming.

"What are you doing, just laying down there?"

She turns over to face herself in the fading sunlight, to face this original version of herself, her original self, unsure of the originality of her memory, the first memory.
