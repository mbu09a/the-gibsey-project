"Oh, Arieol, Arieol, please, oh! Oh! That feels so good Arieol! Keep going! Keep doing it, Arieol! Oh, oh! That feels sooooo good!"

It was twitching now, faster, and he was shocked, even further than before, totally frozen to the spot, and such a tundra was already Antarctic, to say the least.

Actually, they're not sure they even yell this since Parlance's eyes haven't moved from off their keyboard.

My dear and astute reader-

No one wants to describe such material.

We just describe what comes to us, and well, uh, sometimes, you have to be a jazz musician that just continues on through whatever solo you've started despite the dissonance which has presented itself, so if the objects in such a scene had to, um, well, had to be described, and well, the thing is, we're already here-we've already begun, so we might as well finish describing them, right?-so if we had to, well, um, describe them: it shoots out, meaning out of the boil, meaning mucus, bile, residue, or maybe something else, surely, it shoots out of it, the boil, or whatever it is, and when it does, again, whatever it is that does, it shoots out like a volcano erupting.
