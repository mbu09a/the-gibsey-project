**QDPI Glyph Lattice (16×4×4) as a Universal Addressing Scheme**
*Architectural Strategist Note – Gibsey Platform*

---

### 1. Glyph Structure and Mapping

Each glyph is composed of:

1. **Symbol** (16 possibilities, e.g., 0-F hex)
2. **Orientation** (4 possibilities, e.g., N/E/S/W)
3. **Parity** (4 possibilities, e.g., 2 bits or four “colors”)

**Mapping to Platform Services**

* **Symbol → Service-Mesh Routing Key**

  * Each of the 16 symbols routes requests to a dedicated microservice or service-lane.
  * Example: Symbol `0xA` → Analytics Service; Symbol `0xE` → External Gateway.

* **Orientation → Permission Levels**

  * Four orientations can represent *scope* or *role level*, such as:

    * N = Admin / Trusted
    * E = User / Standard
    * S = Read-Only / Limited
    * W = Public / Guest
  * Orientation informs authentication gateways about allowable actions.

* **Parity → Integrity Checks**

  * The 2-bit parity is used to embed a *lightweight signature or check-sum variant*.
  * Parity mismatch triggers an additional verification step (e.g., hashed ledger entry check).

### 2. Sharding Strategy for Postgres + pgvector

1. **Shard Key (High Nibble)**

   * Use the *Symbol* (high nibble) as the primary shard key.
   * Example: For a glyph `0xA [East, P2]`, the shard key is `A` (hex). This routes to shard `10`.

2. **Read/Write Scaling (Low 4 Bits)**

   * Combine Orientation (2 bits) + Parity (2 bits) into a 4-bit suffix that determines read vs. write replicas.
   * For each high-nibble shard, maintain 16 read replicas (one per orientation+parity combination) and a single write master.
   * If orientation indicates an elevated permission, route to the write replica. Otherwise, read-only replica.

**Example**

```
Glyph = 0xA (Symbol = A) | Orientation = 1 | Parity = 2
Shard Key = “A”
Replica = “A-0x6”   (low nibble = 0b110, combining orientation + parity)
Route → shard A, replica index 6
```

### 4. Failure-Mode Table

| **Failure Mode**              | **Description**                                                       | **Impact**                                                          | **Mitigation**                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lost Orientation/Rotation** | If a glyph’s orientation is unknown, permission level becomes unclear | Risk of over-privileged or under-privileged access.                 | Fallback to strict deny or lowest-permission setting. Re-derive from ledger. |
| **Spoofed Parity Marks**      | Parity bits tampered or incorrect                                     | Integrity checks fail or skip needed validation.                    | Enforce checks at ingest + periodic re-check. Audit ledger signatures.       |
| **Symbol Collisions**         | Two microservices incorrectly claim the same symbol routing key       | Requests route to incorrect endpoints → confusion/lost transactions | Assign unique symbols via config management. Validate collisions at startup. |
| **Replica Lag**               | Write replica out-of-sync with read replicas                          | Outdated data for orientation or parity re-checks.                  | Implement streaming replication with heartbeat checks. Retriable reads.      |

#### **Summary**

Using the QDPI glyph lattice as a universal addressing scheme optimizes microservice routing, ensures fine-grained permission checks, and couples data integrity (via parity) within a single compact identifier. Sharding Postgres by symbol and differentiating replicas via orientation+parity allows both horizontal and vertical scaling while maintaining clear, auditable routing paths.
