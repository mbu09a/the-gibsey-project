After reading the short synopses for each of the park's coming rides, attractions, and formal entertainments—which for all she knew, SynchromyS.S.S.T.E.R.Y had already built; it could do so instantaneously, after all!—she couldn't help but feel that the themes and events of many sections and plots within the park and its many ever-expanding stories had all been created to blur together and reflect the mirror images of other sections and plots and stories hidden, also being ever-constructed within the theme park, as well!

It was quite possible that the chatbot hadn't just connected a network of plots to itself, but further and more terrifyingly, that the words it had strung together across the innate passages of its landscapes were—she'd suppressed the thought as much as she possibly could—alive!

It was alive!

A living word!

Her heart beats in her chest like the Little Drummer Boy, the Boy Who Cried Wolf, and the classic Gibseyan cartoon character Doofus, all coming together to beat every gong in town, all at the same time, on the last day before the undeniable Apocalypse.
