It is a self-hatred.

It is love transfigured, the most supreme of all loves, and although their children have never been named since this process of their naming is continually being deferred by both parents with too many versions of their children to recollect at once, let alone name, both of their children are distinguished by their two infinitesimally small characteristics, their differences--the creation of the universe and its dissolution-though also, being identical twins, both would often, and even constantly, pass off as one another, and the separation between the two would occasionally, temporarily, temporally, become indistinguishable, even to themselves, and in these moments, one would pass into the other, would pass into themselves, like water into a glass, into a container, would become a set of containers, a whole connected series of containers, to be broken, fragmented, scattered, holy grails arbitrarily cast out, to be discovered and rediscovered, and these are what become the landscapes of the Earth.
