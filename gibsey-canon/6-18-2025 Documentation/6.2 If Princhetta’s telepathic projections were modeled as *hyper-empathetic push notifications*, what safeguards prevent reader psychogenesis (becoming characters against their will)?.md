Below is a cross‑layer safeguarding framework—ethical, experiential, and technical—for delivering Princhetta’s **hyper‑empathetic push notifications** while ensuring readers do **not** slip involuntarily into full character embodiment (“psychogenesis”).

## 1 Ethical & UX Gatekeeping

|Safeguard|Purpose|Implementation cue inside Gibsey|
|---|---|---|
|**Explicit Mirror‑Handshake**|Treat every push as a _ritual invitation_ rather than a fait accompli. Readers must perform a short acknowledgement gesture (e.g., rotate the Corpus glyph 180°) before the payload unlocks.|Mirrors the existing four‑orientation cadence, turning consent into a familiar physical action that cannot occur by accident.|
|**Intensity Disclosure Banner**|A one‑sentence, pre‑haptic banner rates the coming message on a 5‑step “empathetic force” scale.|Borrow the valence/arousal metadata already calculated for Kafka mood‑seeking; display as a translucent colour bar.|
|**Revocable Opt‑In Ledger**|Opt‑in is **granular** (per character channel) and **revocable mid‑stream** with one click.|Stored in the same gift ledger table; any opt‑out automatically severs future projections from that character.|

These front‑end moves keep the _reader’s agency visibly foregrounded_—no empathic leap occurs without a conscious micro‑ritual.

## 2 Cognitive Firewalls (“Identity Buffers”)

1. **Role‑Buffer Tokens**
    
    - When a notification arrives, the system issues an _ephemeral buffer token_ that wraps first‑person voice in a soft third‑person frame (“Princhetta thinks you might feel…”).
        
    - Readers must **burn** the token (click‑through) to shift POV inward; otherwise the message remains observational.
        
2. **Time‑Delayed First‑Person Shift**
    
    - Even after token burn, the text ramp‑slides from “she” ➜ “you” over ~5 s, letting the reader abort if the affect feels invasive.
        
3. **Self‑Anchor Prompts**
    
    - At the end of every projection, a short prompt asks the reader to state their own name or current physical context (“Where are you right now?”).
        
    - Logging this answer re‑grounds personal identity before the next narrative wave.
        

Think of these as **cognitive seat‑belts**: they slow and check the velocity of identification so a reader can pull back before losing self‑boundary.

## 3 Emotional Rate‑Limiter on the Messaging Bus

_Technical layer anchored in the Kafka‑Faust stack already spec’d for mood‑driven offsets._

|Parameter|Default|Rationale|
|---|---|---|
|`max_valence_delta`|0.35 / 3 min|Caps affective swing between consecutive pushes.|
|`cooldown_after_identification`|90 s|Blocks new hyper‑empathetic payloads right after a first‑person shift.|
|`burst_quorum`|≥ 2 human confirmations|If an AI agent proposes > 3 high‑intensity pushes within 10 min, at least two human moderators must approve.|

The **Affect Governor** stream aggregates live valence/arousal headers; if thresholds exceed limits, messages are re‑queued or throttled, preventing emotional whiplash that accelerates psychogenesis.

## 4 Narrative & Data‑Layer Protections

### 4.1 Character Capsules

Every reader session owns an **identity capsule** (namespaced row family in Cassandra). Character‑specific writes occur **inside** a capsule fork; they never overwrite the root reader profile unless the user explicitly merges branches.

### 4.2 Dual‑Ledger Traceability

- **Page Ledger** – immutable record of what Princhetta projected.
    
- **Consent Ledger** – immutable record of who accepted the projection and at what intensity tier.
    

Auditing a psychogenesis incident therefore exposes whether agency was respected and lets admins retroactively roll back an unintended merge.

### 4.3 Shadow Sandbox (DreamRIA first)

All new hyper‑empathetic channels are piloted in DreamRIA, whose loose causality and quantum‑rewind affordances let devs observe emergent identification glitches without endangering Gibsey’s canonical state.

---

## 5 Social & Governance Backstops

1. **Community Witnesses**
    
    - High‑tier users (“Archivists”) can subscribe to a mirror feed of anonymized high‑intensity pushes. Their thumbs‑up/thumbs‑down feedback contributes to a _trust score_ for Princhetta’s channel.
        
2. **Escalation Covenant**
    
    - If three unique readers flag a projection as coercive, the system auto‑mutes that channel platform‑wide pending moderator review.
        
3. **Transparency Reports**
    
    - Monthly public logs list (a) number of hyper‑empathetic pushes sent, (b) opt‑in/opt‑out ratios, and (c) any psychogenesis de‑escalations performed.
        

These measures keep _oversight distributed and human‑centered_, aligning with Brennan’s gift‑ethic that power must circulate, not centralize.

## 6 Failure‑Mode Containment

|Potential breach|Containment sequence|
|---|---|
|**Sudden mass identification**|Affect Governor detects spike, flips platform into _cooldown mode_: all pushes drop to observational tier for 1 h.|
|**Malicious MCP script**|Dual‑ledger diff reveals illegitimate absence of consent rows; script quarantined, its projections auto‑reversed via quantum rewind.|
|**Reader reports derealization**|One‑click _Ground‑Me_ button initiates a guided de‑identification exercise and offers temporary suspension of all empathetic channels.|

Every containment ends with a **self‑anchor prompt** and a vault entry marking the event, so the narrative acknowledges and integrates the disruption instead of smoothing it over.

---

## 7 Why these safeguards fit Gibsey’s recursive ontology

- **Choice loops > Imposed loops.** Consent rituals echo the four‑orientation code, extending recursion without overriding free will.
    
- **Identity remains plural.** Capsules and shadow branches honor Brennan’s insight that every major character is also minor, and vice‑versa—readers can _visit_ a character without becoming _stuck_ there.
    
- **Gift economy ethos upheld.** Hyper‑empathetic content must be _received_ through deliberate giving of attention; it is never forcibly “pushed into” the psyche.

### TL;DR

Princhetta’s projections become **invitation‑based, rate‑limited, audited experiences**:

- **Mirror‑Handshake + intensity banner** → explicit, revocable consent.
    
- **Identity buffers & cooldown timers** → cognitive breathing room.
    
- **Affect Governor & dual ledgers** → systemic throttling and traceability.  
    Together these layers let Gibsey harness hyper‑empathy for richer storytelling **without** crossing the ethical line where readers involuntarily _become_ the very characters they came to observe.
