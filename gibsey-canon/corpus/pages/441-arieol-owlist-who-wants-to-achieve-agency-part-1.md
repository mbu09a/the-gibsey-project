But then there's also roller coasters-which by the way, we haven't even gotten to a single one yet, Cosmos Monument, be damned-but, ah hell, who's gonna read this anyway? Who could even remotely take the time out of time to sit through this putrid ass dark ride, to have their skin scorched while sliding down the clearly-gonna-burn-your-ass-off reflective metal down into the gravel below.

It's the trash can all over again, or maybe it's the slide all over again, another slide, here to extend whatever disappointment's here to perch upon his shoulder.

Nah, whatever curse is seen as a curse can always instead be seen as a blessing in drag, he's known about that for ages, even knew about it back when slides were fun. It was why you tried the metal ones occasionally even with the sun stared down at you, blistering, bulbous, taunting you, dumb ass that you are. We all know it's gonna be hot, so hot it could even burn our wings clean off, and yet we slide down it anyway, so there's gotta be something that we get out of it? It can't all be heat and death, can it? Some sort of lesson?

But he doesn't want lessons, he wants to be grown up, damn it, when no more lessons are needed!

No he doesn't.

What grown up person, with any sort of self respect sits in a public place, with a digital typewriter on their lap, flapping down on the keys about a theme park that never ended (or never ends)?

Whoever did or does that is, well, if they're anything, they ain't no adult.
