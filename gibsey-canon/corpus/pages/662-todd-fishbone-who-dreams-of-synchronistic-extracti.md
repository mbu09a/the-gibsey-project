You're our guide. If you die, we're fucked, but the Shaykh doesn't care, and he's like "I've got to do this," and so they're forced to let him try, and then, and then--what the ever-living fuck--and the, the-how?--then the Skayk, "mounted the ladder, calling on the name of the Lord and reciting the Verses of Safety."

Todd stops reading.

"What the fuck!" He yells out, "What the fuck!"

"...the safety inside," the phrase plummets down upon him like an anvil to the head.

The safety inside, the safety inside, the fucking safety inside!

"What the ever living fuck!?" He yells out again.
