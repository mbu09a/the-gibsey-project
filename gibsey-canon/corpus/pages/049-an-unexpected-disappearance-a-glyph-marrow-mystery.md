Who is it that's speaking to me?

I'm living in a receiver.

As a receiver.

I'm a living reservoir.

It contains water.

I contain water.

It is a container, this place within which I am contained.

And it flows.

Along with the water of breath.

My energy.

My home flows both with and within the water.

If you should ever need water to drink, it flows from the spigot of my life into the chalice of the great lake that is the purity of my soul, below all things.
