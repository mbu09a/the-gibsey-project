"Gibsey-" He mutters, annoyed with himself.

He rushes to the kitchen to get paper towels and a stain remover spray, thrusting the TV dinner in his trash can.

The "Previously-on The Princhetta Diaries" section of the show-much longer than most, Phillip observes while punching the buttons of his microwave-cuts to another talking head clip of Gillespie adding, "She's always had an interest, even from the beginning, in how the park expands upon itself. I think because she lives inside it, which as you know, isn't common. It's a privileged position to be able to live inside the park, like she does, rather than outside it. It's fascinating. She doesn't know how lucky she really is. She's insulated, you could say. Plus, we still don't know if she's aware of anything or not outside of what we've programmed her to know, and we can't know. Not until she leaves."

An interviewer off camera asks, "Well what do you think this means for the show if she's already starting to test boundaries like this?"

Gillespie answers, "Oh, well, she hasn't really escaped if she's on the balcony, and even if she does, we can always change the boundaries we've set for her. We're the creators of the show, after all, aren't we? We can't ever really know for certain, anyway. So why jeopardize the show, even if she does escape? We want the show to keep expanding, just like the park does."
