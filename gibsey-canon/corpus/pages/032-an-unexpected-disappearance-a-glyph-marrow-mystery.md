Above is a sign that's labeled: Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Mining Co.

So already, when I start my walk, I usually start out a bit confused. Why did a theme park such as this one decide to create one of its most iconic rides as an homage to one of the most exploitative fields of labor to ever exist, mining?

And even thinking about that, how do I know about such Gibstories? Words come to mind when I've think about such ideas, entire phrases which I barely understand, and I watch them as they pass me like a ride vehicle that's passing a queue line, a ride vehicle that's strategically arranged to help both distract from and prepare park-goers for what's to come, and I continue with my walk, unsure of what they mean, the words. Ludlow, Blair Mountain, Italian Hall, Marikana, Lattimer, Cripple Creek, Colorado, Morewood, Herrin. The words flash by me like neon signs passing in the night, leaving that ghostly after-glow that such burning lights tend to leave behind themselves, like when you nod off in your car seat, and they blur past you, past your vision, and into the depths of your dreams.

Were they some sort of code, the words?

I never linger on them for long—the words, the objects—and instead, I continue with my walk.
