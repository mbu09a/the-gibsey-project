There was no reason to get highly involved in a case like this one, especially not for Phillip, and truth be told, he almost turned around right then and there.

He probably should have.

But a thought comes to him.

Sure, this was a maximal space, but if anyone was going to turn this cluttered disorder into a composed and organized minimalism, it was Phillip Bafflemint.

He could sense a quasi-religous urge pushing him forward, like a calling of some kind. It felt as if some higher-power not even yet contacted before by humankind, had tapped him on the shoulder to whisper in his ear, "Phillip, this place is a mess, and you've gotta be the one to clean it up."

He pulled his self-made playlist that had as many versions of Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1 on repeat as he could find, put headphones from his car into each of his ears, and got to work.

It didn't all happen at once.

Nothing ever does.
