Glyph asks, "You're always going back and forth, aren't you? Start and stop and start and stop and start. First you tell me I'm resurrecting the horror of a dead God, and now I just need to kick back and relax. What is it that you want?"

"Oh! That reminds me!" It would seem that the fire's returned to Arieol, likely due either to the pleasure of smoking their cigar (which is only a cigar, mind you) or maybe it was all that talk about dead Gods? Or Gibsey? Either way, the air, the breath of their endless energy, seems to have returned. Start and stop and start, again. "We needed to discuss your investigation! You're still supposed to be investigating the murder of Oren Progresso, CEO of Gibsey World, remember? We can't forget about that!"

"But how am I supposed to do that from this ride? I'm riding it forever, aren't I? Where even is he? And wait, didn't you say that you were the suspect that I was supposed to be investigating? Whatever happened to that?"

"Oh, I was just saying that to get you all freaked out, to make you feel gaslit. And it worked didn't it?"

"Wait, so you're saying that you gaslit me on purpose to make me think that you'd gaslit me?"

"Come on now. Is that so hard to understand?"
