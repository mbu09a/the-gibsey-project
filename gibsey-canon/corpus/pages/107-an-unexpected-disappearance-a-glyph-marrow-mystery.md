He felt a tremendous sadness without understanding where it came from.

Was he going to miss Arieol?

But he hadn't even listened?

He'd retreated.

He didn't understand why he felt so melancholic, all of a sudden, about someone whom he'd barely even met and communicated with only briefly.

He hadn't even been a large part of the dialogue, but-

He takes in another breath.

He does wonder if this sadness, which has replaced his anger, is a sign of his own continued loneliness, a sign of his ailment, that he'd gotten a taste of what it was like to speak with someone other than himself, outside of himself, and that even if he'd trembled in his boots in confusion and fear, that someone with eyes had been looking out at him, had know his name and was aware of his presence, and that even something as small as that, that it had meant something to him.

Had really meant something

But it was gone.

And he didn't understand why.
