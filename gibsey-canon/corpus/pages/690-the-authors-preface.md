Although not entirely amnesiatic, they're often forgetful, and they don't remember exactly where they are or who they are, let alone who they once were before coming here to inhabit this environment, this landscape.

They don't remember the ever-changing, continually adapted, continually updated, endlessly written portrait, self-portrait, diegetic, non-diegetic, live-action, animated, movie, film, book, novel, epic-poem, cartoon, digital, part-video-game, part-visual-novel, art project, multimodal, multimedia experience that they'd originally been the creator of, and which they were (and are) the author of, the novel experience for which they were and still are often known: The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey.

They've forgotten all about it.

And they're still forgetting.

There are many things which they won't and don't remember.

They don't remember their age or their gender.

They don't remember the checkerboarded top half of the maroon fence in the backyard where they grew up.

They don't remember that before it spread like a virus, subsuming, not just the country of its origin, but all civilizations, Gibsey World first began as an amusement park, and it still exists as an amusement park.

They don't remember.
