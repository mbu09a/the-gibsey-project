Now, to continue.

I'm there to cut the budget.

The cast members enter from backstage, and their movements.

My Gibsey, their movements, let me tell you, they're about as calculated as the late-Victorian architecture that surrounds them. I mean it, Malt Gibsey, they're good. They're all top notch performers. They're these twisting, twirling columns, these perfected monumental smiles. They're like moving statues, adorned with makeup and whimsy, and they're dancing so well, and singing like goddamn angels. They could rival the cast members of the actual park, mind you, and they do. Maybe even better.

God you should've heard them.

You should've seen them, really. You should've been there, Arieol.

It was truly wonderfully done, but no matter how on point they are, no matter how well they're hitting their cues, Scrillio doesn't seem to think it's going the way he wants it.

Cut this, cut that.

Fuck this, fuck that.

But they just keep going on with the scene, trying to get the section for the opening theme song the way this fuming, narcissistic, imbecilic last fucking 'auteur' wants it.

Fuck those goddamn articles.
