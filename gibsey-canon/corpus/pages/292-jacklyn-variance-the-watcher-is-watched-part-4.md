Sometimes you do, but not often.

Certainly not with Preston.

It didn't have a reason.

Reasons for something such as this would be insulting to reason itself.

It just happened.

Sometimes, it just happens.

She finds herself seated in church pews, later at picnic tables, trying to eat cupcakes but not even able to take a bite, and later, crying heavily, alone, driving to work, trying to pull herself together.

How had it happened?

How could she have been so careless in her perceptions?

Was there something she could have seen?

Some piece of data trapped in her memories that could unlock it all, that could help her go back, to transform the past that led up to this moment?

Did that also come down to perception?
