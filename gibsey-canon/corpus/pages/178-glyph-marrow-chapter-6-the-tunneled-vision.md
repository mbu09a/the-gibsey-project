Funnily enough, wandering to and fro the queue station and platform, Glyph didn't typically have too hard of a time losing himself much before, but it certainly has become a problem as of late, at least ever since he's tried riding the ride.

Huh? Sounds like an obstacle he may need to overcome?

And as that fragment of light flashes over him, like a solar flare streaming across a lens in JJ Abrams flick, he's blinded a bit, and so he puts up a hand to cover his eyes in shadow, and upon doing so, who else is to return from their backstage position to the center stage of the seat next to him, maybe even through the transportive blur of the light itself, but Arieol Owlist.

Looks like that didactic trickster who'd disappeared, like so many, and they're unexpectedly back for more.

"Departure and return, Glyph! Don't you know anything?"

Again, Glyph's eyes are about as wide as a football field doing its morning stretching routines, but this time, being a bit more comfortable with his place on the ride, he manages to even greet the son-and/or-daughter-of-a-bitch.

"Arieol? You're back?"

"In the flesh," Arieol winks along with another of those infinitely various grins of theirs.
