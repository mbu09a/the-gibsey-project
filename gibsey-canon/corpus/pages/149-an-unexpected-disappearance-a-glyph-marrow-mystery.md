Stephen Morrison was a friend of The Author's that they'd first met in college. They'd become very close, both during school and out of it.

But a few Junes ago, The Author had gotten the call that Stephen had passed away suddenly.

He'd disappeared unexpectedly.

And he'd been so young?

It was all such a mystery.

The biggest mystery The Author had ever encountered.

How had it happened?

Why?

"Is it death that's so hard for you to talk about?"

"Oh, hell no. That shit's like drinking water."

"Then what is it?"

"Well, I loved him. You know that." They'd talked about it before, many times.

"I do."
