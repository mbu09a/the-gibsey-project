He paces in a circle, nearly tripping over the cluttered mess he's continually putting off dealing with.

Ok, Ok, calm down.

Calm down.

He hasn't even gotten to the automaton section yet.

And they haven't even made it into the city!

Inside the city.

He steadies himself.

He counts to ten.

"...the safety inside."

He opens the book back up, returning to the section where he left off.

He-where was it?

Oh yeah.

He turns to the section where the Shaykh is going up the ladder.

Ok, Ok, that's right.

The Shaykh reaches the top and looks down and all who have tried before him cry out, warning him, telling him to turn back that they'll all be dead soon-which again is just like those other warnings, he's really starting to sweat; Todd really starts to sweat-but then the Shaykh laughs beyond all measure-what the fuck? He laughs? These are people he's traveled with for a year plus now and he laughs? What the hell?--and he repeats the Verses of Safety--again, what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?-and the Shaykh gets all excited and yells out to Emir that they're gonna be fine, and Emir's like, "What did you see?"

And the Shaykh answers, telling him he's seen ten maidens.

What the hell?
