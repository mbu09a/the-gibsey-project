His mission is to investigate the murder of Oren Progresso, and it's quite possible that despite the encased complexity of his leaking attention, that his awareness may also contain other layers of awareness not always accessible to his conscious attention, or at least which remain often distant from it-in two places at once-which means that he's somehow managed to wiggle his way into a hotel room at the resort where Oren Progresso's dead body has been laid, the tomb where it is contained, and in this case, this is a CEO, for him anyway, that literally seems to have fallen straight out of the sky, the tombed sky, and this concept of purgatory reaches him as he watches the body and takes notes which he is also trying not to consciously take, a trick of the trade of many detectives being to let the attentive detail leak through, like ink, like oil, like stains, until the container of the mind is filled and needs to be emptied, or at least the container of his notebook, which is now filled, and so he turns a page.
