Well, and I thought you were stretching a bit earlier, but I see what you mean now. Inaction itself can be a form of violence, and has throughout Gibstory, a terrifying thought, no doubt.

That appropriation has always been ubiquitous and likely existed in some form here before even we came along, but that doesn't mean we didn't accelerate it to unprecedented levels of horrific violence. And I want to make sure to mention: I'm not trying to normalize or naturalize the exploitation of our Gibstory. It involved the flat out eradication of most of the native peoples of this land. If looked at closely, however, it's certainly possible that a ride such as Even More Substantially Sizable Thunder Monument does, in fact, naturalize such a Gibstory, which is why it's essential to prod and question from a Gibstorical.

Does it not tell the story of a ghost train haunted by a Native American curse in a theme park that's visited by the ancestors of the very people who exploited and slaughtered those that are supposedly getting "revenge" magically within the story through the ghost town element of the ride, the flood, the natural disasters of all its various versions? That could be read as a cautionary tale, a warning. Either that, or it could read as bragging about the fact that we got away with it, and in that way, maybe Glyph's ineffectual nature is just a Gibstory of that sort of mindless violence, or a form of that violence.
