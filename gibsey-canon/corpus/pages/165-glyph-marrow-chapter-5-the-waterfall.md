It lingers in their glass like melting ice after they've finished their first drink of the night, that they crunch in their teeth while they wait, knowing that they're not the kind of person who can easily get the bartender's attention. They'll just have to stay here and crunch on the rest of the ice until it's gone and the glass will be next, the glass which they'll chomp like some feral dog, they'll go full on werewolf on its ass if this fucker doesn't show up-

They're already back in the car, dripping with rain.

What had happened?

Why hadn't they shown up?

They hit the steering wheel and try not to cry about it, if they're being perfectly honest.

They may or may not have been successful at that.
