Had you read the book before?

Oh, great. Ah, I see, yes. No, that's OK. I'm glad you mentioned it.

You're right. So in the previous scene, Arieol had discussed this concept of the monologic and the dialogic. No, I'm actually really glad that you mentioned that. That's a very important contextual piece that will be a perfect transition for me back into the stuff I was wanting to talk about today regarding The Flooded Town section of the ride, or at least the Gibseyan Mysticism that can be unpacked there.

Yes, yes.

So if you didn't hear them, and I know we haven't all read the book-really don't worry about it--they were saying that the monologic and dialogic modes are discussed as two interconnected, maybe even inseparable modes.
