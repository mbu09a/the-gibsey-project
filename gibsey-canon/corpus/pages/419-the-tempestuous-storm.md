"Ah, interesting. So you teach Gibstory! Well, alright. You know? That makes sense. You look like a Gibstory teacher." Again with that smile of his.

"Yeah?"

"Yep. I could've guessed it."

"And what does a Gibstory teacher look like?"

"Well it looks like you. Smart, ya know. You've got glasses. Sort of androgenous looking. If you don't mind me saying. I mean in terms of your dress." The smile is gone now, is replaced with a flustering nervousness as he realizes he likely shouldn't have said what he said in the way that he said it. He starts to stumble over himself. "Sort of a mix between male and female dress. Cardigan, corduroy, shoulder pads, that sort of thing. Oh, come on, you know what I'm saying!"

Did she?

"You must know a bunch about the parks, then? I'm so curious," he continues, trying to quickly return to the original smile, trying to recover.
