Surely this was all just Arieol's bitterness speaking, and taking over them.

What about desire?

True and meaningful desire?

Life and love, in all its radiant rarity.

In such an environment was there any at all left to be excavated, anywhere?

It had occurred at some point in their relationship, hadn't it?

Day-time-imagined-nightmares of being ripped to shreds through cannibalistic ritual murder suggested they were well past the honeymoon stage.

But they'd loved Oren, maybe even still did.

But they didn't have much of a choice.

This is what they were processing, and that was the shit of it.

But Arieol, being the shape-shifter that they are, and thinking they'd gotten pretty good at it, also can't help but wonder if there wasn't maybe some way back to the rendezvous point.

Wasn't there?

One can only hope for such a realization, but by Gibsey, they're not even on the third Tarot card yet!

What even was the 2nd?

Oh yeah!

They'd just prepped it but hadn't even turned it over yet.

The X of Swords.

Wait, the wait?

The fucking what?

How did they-THIS?!
