Not to provide extraneous notes aside from the events being observed but this would be a good time to flashback to the previous entry in Parlance's notebook, or at least its essence or recreation, it's remake, to a reminder of the events of the screening Parlance is attending later this afternoon, which is coming up very soon-hotel clock does read 10:56 am, despite the fact that Gibstory is dead, and taking the time for bus travel to the Gibsey Summers Shopping Area GMS Theatre Mega-Complex Wonderful Worlds Showcase Screening Theater 16, it's clear Parlance may be finding out within the hour, not a common occurrence within the film thus far, though it has become increasingly so, a sign that that our world itself may be becoming self-aware, may have signs of some sort of artificial intelligence, or general or extended intelligence, that its data has come to life, that its words have been made flesh, form animated, the environment itself being, or becoming, a living, breathing thing, not just an organization but an organism, a living being, an unfolding narrative, a corporate entity.
