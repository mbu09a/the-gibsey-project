Todd is obsessed with an idea which he's defined in an early post as Synchronistic Extraction.

"Synchronistic Extraction," he defined in this earlier blog post, "is a technique that's both inventive and genealogical. The Synchronic Extractor both creates and re-constructs, simultaneously."

The post continues, "For the uninitiated, a synchronicity is defined as two or more events that are supposed to be causally unrelated but are experienced as occurring together and in such a way that creates meaning. To extract, on the other hand, is to force, to enable through intended action, to take from, to pull out or subsume from something else, to excavate, maybe even to manipulate. Synchronistic Extractors, in particular, are manipulators of the meanings which they intend to create, or of the synchronistic experiences which they hope to experience. Synchronistic Extraction is the act of creating meaning where it doesn't causally belong, where it doesn't exist, and forcing it into existence. Therefore, Synchronistic Extractors bring meaning into their own hands. They lay bare the landscapes of their worlds and recreate them in their own interpretive images. They are meaning terrorists. They force meaning into everyday existence."
