"But I just wanted to know if-if there was something between us or not. You've meant so much to me."

"Is that not enough?"

"I guess I just, well, I wanted to know whether you loved me or not."

"Did you really not know already?"

"I had a feeling you'd say that."

"And what else did you think I was gonna say?"

"I thought you'd tell me that-" The Author starts to cry. They hate how much it's happened already. It's a Gibsey joint, after all, but still. It's embarrassing. "I thought you'd tell me that it's better not to know for sure. That if I did know, that I'd probably let go for good, but if I didn't, then I could go on feeling how I felt forever."

"Do I say anything else?"

"No, I guess that's about it."

"Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I never said any of that."

The Author laughs really hard at that one.

"And you know, I think it's better that way."

"I agree."
