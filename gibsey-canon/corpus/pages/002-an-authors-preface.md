Again, I do not know the identity of The Author of these various tales. But regardless of my conscious or unconscious awareness (or lack thereof) regarding this work's creator or destroyer, I know one data point for certain.

As collector and curator of these tales, I am a Scheherazade in reverse.

For the uninitiated, Scheherazade is the ingenious heroine of One Thousand and One Nights who, through the use of a frame narrative, enchants a king, night after night, with striking, digressive, and incomplete stories, all in order to defer her expected execution.

And upon framing myself as a Scheherazade in reverse, in this way, I could be suggesting one of two things (or possibly many more than two things, but at least two things which I, as an author, will temporarily identify). Firstly, this could suggest that I, myself, am a ruthless murderer of sorts, one who's imprisoned a Scheherazade deep within my own Magical Dominion, forcing her to tell me an infinite, or near-infinite, series of stories, all in order to prolong her expected disappearance.
