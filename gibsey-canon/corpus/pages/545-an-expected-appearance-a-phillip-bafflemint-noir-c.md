Phillip steps out of the vehicle.

And as if zapped up by the beam of an Unidentified Flying Object, Philip starts floating towards the front door of 19991 Thanatos Drive.

The Author is an unidentified flying object.

It's in the air.

Can you hear it?

There are no houses three doors down to speak of.

There are no other lights to be found in the while area.

None.

Only the spotlight planted on 19991 Thanatos Drive.

All is shrouded in darkness.

He approaches the door.

The Entrance Way to the Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey.

He clutches the knob.

And turns.
