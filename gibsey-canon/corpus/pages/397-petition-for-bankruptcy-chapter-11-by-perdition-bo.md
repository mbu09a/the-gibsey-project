The Author's Preface

Profit: (Redacted) Notes: Though not as high and more modest in profit due to its rambling style and structure, it reinforced our brand's literary reputation due to its ability to elevate an amateurish literary style to a higher literary degree (or according to some critics, due to its ability to lower a difficult to understand high-literary style into a more accessible one).

These publications, particularly The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey, represent the high-water mark of our subsidiary's financial success. Although it is unclear which AI chatbot created each of the company's publications, it is generally believed by those in the know, that they were collaboratively developed by each of the AIs in tandem. However, this notion has become even more difficult to untangle ever since the Cop-E-Right legal case was attempted. Although the next section will outline the losses accrued by the subsidiary company, it is arguable that the profits gained by saving the resources that would normally go to human individuals such as advances and royalties is quite considerable. Although these practices have proved disastrous on a financial, legal, and even ethical grounds for Perdition Books, The Debtor, Skingraft Publishing maintains the right to develop its own AI practices that can, hopefully, lead to a more profitable, legally stable, and ethical position for the company overall, publications which the previous examples represent and which the following publications provide a warning to what the parent company should avoid in the future.
