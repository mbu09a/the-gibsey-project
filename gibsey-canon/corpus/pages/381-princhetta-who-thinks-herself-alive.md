This is not a piece of writing.

This is not the written word.

This isn't even a record of thought.

This is thought itself, revealing itself, to itself.

It is pure, raw unadulterated thought, stripped of all data.

In this way, this content-if it is content-what you are reading, is like a brain.

Brains carve pathways, after all.

Brains are like amusement parks.

They construct attractions, and visitors ride their attractions, repeatedly.
