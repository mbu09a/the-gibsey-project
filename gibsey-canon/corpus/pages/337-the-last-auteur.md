Petey Puff holds his arms out, stumbling around like some kind of french-fried Frankensten. "Wha-wha-where am I?" Their nasally voice echoes out to all the other bodies on set. And I mean, Petey Puff, you know who he is, he's a classic, nearly mythic character, a classic Gibseyan persona, and my Gibsey are there so many. Some of us, on this set, we're doubled over at this point. We're holding our sides, trying not to let out air and accidentally interrupt the sound that's being recorded.

He's just that good.

Like I've said, they're doing a fucking great job, a fantastic job, the cast members.

And another cast member enters, costumed as a police officer, from stage left with a set of handcuffs, and places them over Petey's wrists.

"Hip-hip-hooray!" Each member of the chorus holds an arm up in triumph at the theater of Petey's capture and the shooting of the theme song continues. Scrillio shakes his head all the while, mouthing "It's not right. Not right. Not right at all."

No more pizza, nor fruit punch But Puffy's got t' munch Petey Puff is stoned again!
