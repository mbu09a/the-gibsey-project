The Author walks among the statues they'd built waiting for the rain and thunder beating down outside their apartment to reach them, but nothing comes.

The manuscript was already finished.

It was Day 10.

They'd held it against both arms as they waddled to their car.

Glyph held them in their arms, held Shamrock Stillman, in their arms.

The Author would write it into existence if they had to, will them back to life, translate the love they'd felt in whatever way they could.

It had to be done.

They would hold them in their arms.

But it just didn't feel right.

Didn't feel real.

But, real or not, The Author did hold a deep belief in the power of vulnerability.

In the exposing of an open wound.

In recognition,

Identification.

Whatever it took.

An attempt would have to be made.

They would hold them in their arms.
