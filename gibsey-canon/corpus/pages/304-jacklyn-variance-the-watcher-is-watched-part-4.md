December afternoon.

A pale sky, ringlets of tree branches staggering in fractal play.

You shiver.

It's cold out, colder than you're used to.

Bundled up, rain on the streets, though it's no longer raining now.

A light fog.

Not a day has passed where you haven't thought of him.

You see him in the shirts still hanging in your closet.

In the baseball glove, the novelty joke check he wrote you when you were little, a million dollars--you had so little money growing up-a pair of his glasses in a slip case, and many more objects than this, more you'd like not to think about for now, but which you've placed in boxes which you and your partner move every time you relocate to a new apartment or house, and you hold a few of them every time you do, every few years, you get a chance to hold them again.

They evoke more than any screen ever could and will.

They are what all the screens are always attempting to illuminate

And I see you.

I see you illuminating within them.

I watch you.
