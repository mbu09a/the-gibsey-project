"You think anyone who refers to themselves as The Author within an already digressive chapter in a novel within a novel gives a damn about plot?"

"Well, you're telling a story aren't you?"

"Yes. Or I'm trying to. I just keep setting these challenges for myself that are meant to give me creative limitations, and I keep fucking them up, or worrying about fucking them up so much that I end up fucking them up. I-I don't know."

"Where are you?"

"You mean, like, in the story?"

"Yeah."

"Chapter 4."

"Ok, relatively early then."

"I'd say almost halfway."

"That's encouraging."

"But I'm stalling, I can tell."

"Yeah?"
