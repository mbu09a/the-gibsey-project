And Phillip had starred in the mirror to see the image of The Author, had said, "Huh? Is that what they look like?" while also knowing that this was all a joke, an ironic gesture, because all of the characters were The Author, had always been, and that that was the mystery of it all because it was something that could never be fully expressed or communicated, that it involved a vulnerability, a blood-letting, a sacrifice, and they'd smiled and cried, just as The Author had in the car, and thanked Gibsey for getting to walk through this shitty, cluttered mess of an apartment, not all that dissimilar to Todd Fishbone's living space (you'll see).

And they'd known.

They'd truly known.

Even if it was an end, even if this was the last thing they'd ever write, that it also was a beginning, and upon realizing, The Author had floated back to earth (or Phillip or Manny or London or whoever they were) to waste in the sadness that is the ending of things, to close the door behind them as they enter their apartment to find another door, a different door.
