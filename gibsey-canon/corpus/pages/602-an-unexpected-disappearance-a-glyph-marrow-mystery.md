He continues with his trashing, searching for a door within.

The words.

They cannot save him from the water.

He will drown here.

Until he finds the door.

The Flooded Town will claim him.

Tracks of ghosts.

It is a ride that never ends.

As the screen of his sky darkens,

He sees the outline,

The edge,

Of a door,

The door,

And he swims towards it.

Closing his eyes,

Thrusting himself forward towards it,

The screen of his eyes,

The door.

Fingers outstretched,

Hand upon the handle,

He turns.
