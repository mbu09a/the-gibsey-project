# Plan for Coordinating Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI (Doc 7)

## Overview and Objectives

This document outlines how to orchestrate three AI coding agents – **Claude Code**, **GPT‑5 Codex CLI**, and **Google Gemini CLI** – to work **asynchronously** on the Gibsey Project. Each agent will assume a distinct role aligned to its strengths, ensuring parallel development with minimal conflicts. We define clear responsibilities, **guardrails**, and integration points for each agent. By dividing tasks (backend, symbol logic, and frontend UI), we can accelerate development while maintaining consistency. The end goal is to integrate the **256-symbol QDPI system** with our backend and UI, and prepare for **real-time Kafka event** visualization once the event pipeline is ready.

**Key Objectives:**

- Enable **Claude Code** (Anthropic) as the primary **builder** of backend features (QDPI integration, Kafka event pipeline, etc.).
    
- Utilize **GPT‑5 Codex CLI** as a **symbol logic specialist** to handle the 256 SVG glyph mapping, metadata generation, and enforcement of naming/behavior rules.
    
- Leverage **Google Gemini CLI** as a **UI/UX developer**, focusing on frontend code generation, UI integration with backend APIs, and eventually real-time updates from Kafka events.
    
- Establish an **asynchronous workflow** where agents work in parallel within defined scopes, merging their contributions seamlessly. This includes updating file naming, creating lookup tables (e.g. hex code to SVG path), and ensuring all components align.
    
- Prepare the system to first support **core UI functionality** (frontend integration) and later incorporate **live visual feedback** when Kafka-based events start streaming from the backend.
    

## Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### Claude Code (Anthropic) – **Backend Orchestrator & Code Builder**

**Role:** Claude Code will drive **backend development** and act as a pseudo-“project lead” on implementation. It is responsible for building out the core codebase changes and integrating contributions from the other agents. Claude will **not** focus on low-level symbol data details but will create the structures to plug them in.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Implement QDPI-256 Integration:** Incorporate the 256-symbol alphabet into the backend logic. Using the _QDPI Integration Implementation Plan_ (Doc 3) as a guide, Claude will update the QDPI system code (e.g. `backend/app/qdpi.py`) to use actual SVG glyphs instead of placeholders[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L92-L98). This includes loading the **glyph manifest** (mapping of byte values to symbol files) that Codex provides, and implementing functions for **byte-to-glyph encoding/decoding**[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L92-L98).
    
- **Backend Logic & DSPy Flows:** Implement any necessary logic for **DSPy** modules or multi-agent simulation flows in the backend. For example, ensure that character-specific transformations (Glyph Marrow’s “linguistic vertigo”, etc.) are coded as per design. Claude will integrate these keeping with the design in Doc 3 (QDPI/DSPy plan) – e.g. tying QDPI encoding to character state (like confusion level) if specified.
    
- **Kafka Event Pipeline:** Build and configure the **event streaming** backend using Kafka (related to character Arieol Owlist’s abilities). Claude will create the event producer/consumer logic (e.g. in `backend/app/arieol_owlist_events.py`) to publish events and handle time controls (pause/unpause) as outlined[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/CHARACTER_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#L232-L235). This includes setting up topics, a mechanism to “replay” events (time manipulation), and any pattern-recognition hooks needed (divination-like processing)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/CHARACTER_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#L232-L235). Initially, this can be a stub or simulation if full Kafka cluster integration is heavy – focus on the interface that the front end will subscribe to for live updates.
    
- **API & Integration Points:** Expose any new functionality via API endpoints or WebSocket channels. For example, provide an endpoint to fetch the QDPI symbol manifest or to encode/decode data using QDPI (if not already present), and a WebSocket or SSE endpoint to push Kafka event updates to the UI. Claude ensures these endpoints follow the project’s conventions (e.g. REST endpoints under `/api/…` as in the Retrieval API).
    
- **Coordinator Logic:** Act as the **integration coordinator** in code – once Codex generates the mapping file and Gemini creates UI components, Claude will integrate these into the main application. This might involve writing glue code: e.g. reading the `qdpi_glyph_manifest.json` (from Codex) in the QDPI module, or connecting Gemini’s UI event handler to the Kafka WebSocket. Claude will also handle any required refactoring to accommodate the new features (e.g. adding new config entries, ensuring the build process includes the new glyph assets).
    
- **Testing & Validation:** Use unit tests or manual testing to verify that backend changes work correctly. For instance, after integration, test that encoding a sample string yields the correct sequence of glyph IDs and that decoding retrieves the original text (utilizing the new 256-glyph set). Claude might generate a few test cases (with Codex’s help) to confirm that all 256 symbols are recognized and map correctly.
    
- **Restrictions:** Claude Code should avoid altering the narrative content in `gibsey-canon/corpus` (the story corpus). It focuses on code (`/src`, `/backend`) and high-level documentation. A pre-commit hook already enforces that the Claude agent cannot modify corpus files[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/scripts/pre_commit_agent_scope.sh#L4-L8), keeping content safe from code edits. Claude’s domain is primarily **architecture and implementation**.
    

### GPT‑5 Codex CLI – **Symbol Mapping & Logic Specialist**

**Role:** The Codex CLI agent (GPT-5 model) will ensure the **256 QDPI symbols** are systematically integrated. It acts as the **data preparer and quality enforcer** for the symbol system. This agent will handle all tasks requiring precise mapping, file manipulations, and rule enforcement for the symbolic language, freeing Claude to focus on coding.

**Responsibilities:**

- **SVG Glyph Audit & Renaming:** Scan the `qdpi-256-glyphs/` directory (which contains the 256 SVG symbol files) and ensure all filenames and metadata are consistent. The naming convention should follow the pattern from Phase 1[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L19-L28) – e.g. base symbol name plus rotation suffix (`name_90.svg`, etc.). If any files are misnamed or missing, Codex will rename or regenerate them as needed (e.g. ensure all 4 rotations of each base symbol exist, totalling 256).
    
- **Generate Symbol Metadata (Manifest):** Create a comprehensive **glyph manifest** (e.g. `qdpi_glyph_manifest.json` or a YAML file) listing every glyph’s details[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L25-L28). This manifest maps each glyph’s ID (0–255) to its properties: symbol name, rotation, file name, hex code, etc. An example entry might include fields like:
    
    `{ "glyph_id": 17, "symbol_name": "glyph_marrow", "rotation": 90, "hex": "11", "filename": "glyph_marrow_90.svg" }`
    
    as illustrated in the Phase 1 summary[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L63-L72). Codex will ensure binary/hex values are correctly assigned to each glyph ID and that the manifest covers all IDs 0x00–0xFF with no duplicates[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L84-L89). This manifest will be used by Claude’s code to drive encoding/decoding.
    
- **Lookup Table & Helper Code:** Provide a **lookup table** or mapping functions for the backend. Codex may draft a TypeScript/JSON module or Python snippet that maps byte values (or hex strings) to SVG file paths and vice versa. This could be delivered as data for Claude to integrate (e.g. a JSON consumed by `qdpi.py`) or as utility functions. Essentially, Codex bridges the gap between raw symbol data and code.
    
- **Filename and ID Alignment:** If the project uses specific **symbol IDs** for characters/systems (e.g. Symbol ID 4 = glyph_marrow corresponds to glyph IDs 16–19)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L34-L43), Codex will make sure these relationships are reflected in the manifest. This includes distinguishing the 16 core character symbols vs. 240 “hidden” symbols, as described in the QDPI plan (e.g. IDs 0–15 for main symbols with their rotations, etc.[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L14-L22)). Codex helps enforce that _character-system mapping_ stays intact (each core character’s symbol occupies the correct ID range).
    
- **Validation of Symbol Logic:** Run a validation pass to verify everything is consistent. For example, Codex can write a short script or use logic to confirm that there are indeed 256 unique entries in the manifest, that each base symbol has exactly 4 rotated variants, and that all expected hex codes (00–FF) appear[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L84-L89). This serves as a safeguard before Claude’s code relies on this data. If any issues are found (missing glyphs, mismatches), Codex fixes them now.
    
- **Behavior Enforcement:** Beyond data, Codex (with GPT-5’s reasoning power) will ensure the **rules of the symbol language** are upheld. For instance, if QDPI has constraints (like error correction codes or orientation flips for certain modes), Codex can outline these for Claude. It might produce pseudo-code or comments for Claude indicating how to handle special cases (e.g. a particular symbol rotation might indicate a “flipped” orientation in decoding). Essentially, Codex acts as the **logic referee**, catching edge cases or inconsistencies in how the symbol system should behave.
    
- **Collaboration with Claude:** Codex will provide the above outputs in a form Claude can easily integrate. For example, after generating `qdpi_glyph_manifest.json` and perhaps a `glyph_constants.ts` (if needed for frontend), it will commit those to the repo (under an appropriate path). Claude can then load this data when coding the QDPI module. Codex might also write a brief **integration note** (in markdown or code comments) explaining to Claude how the manifest is structured, ensuring no ambiguity.
    
- **Restrictions:** Codex CLI is **not allowed to modify core code or story content** – by design, it will limit itself to data and documentation changes. The repository’s pre-commit rules reflect this: if the agent `user.agent=codex`, it is forbidden from writing to `src/` (code) or `gibsey-canon/corpus` (narrative)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/scripts/pre_commit_agent_scope.sh#L4-L8). This means Codex’s contributions will be in supporting files (like the manifest JSON, scripts in `scripts/`, or documentation). This separation ensures Codex focuses purely on **symbol data integrity**, leaving actual code implementation to Claude.
    

### Google Gemini CLI – **Front-End UI Developer & Integrator**

**Role:** The Gemini CLI agent will own the **user interface and user experience** aspects. Its focus is on creating and modifying the **frontend code** (React/TypeScript) in line with the design sketches (Docs 4–6). Gemini will translate the _Pseudo-UI Storyboard_ (Doc 5) and _ASCII Wireframe_ (Doc 6) into actual interface components. Initially, it will build and integrate the UI with static or stubbed data; later, it will hook up dynamic behavior such as real-time updates via Kafka events.

**Responsibilities:**

- **UI Framework Setup:** Ensure the front-end environment is ready for new components. The Gibsey Project already uses React + Vite + TailwindCSS[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/README.md#L123-L131), so Gemini will follow this stack. If needed, set up any additional state management or context for the new UI elements (for example, if a context is needed to hold the active symbol or incoming events, define it).
    
- **Implement Visual Design from Storyboards:** Using Doc 5 and Doc 6 as guides, Gemini creates the actual components and pages:
    
    - **Symbol Navigation/Display:** If the UI requires showing all 256 symbols (possibly a scrollable index or a grid of glyphs), Gemini will implement that component. This might extend the existing `SymbolIndex` component (currently built for 16 symbols[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/README.md#L33-L41)) to handle 256 symbols, possibly categorizing them (e.g. by character vs hidden, or 16 groups of 16).
        
    - **Holographic 4D Effect:** Doc 4’s _Visual Systems Sketch_ hints at evolving from 2D symbols to a “4D holography” experience. Gemini will interpret this by adding dynamic visual elements – e.g. animations or transformations on symbols to represent the fourth dimension (time or depth). This could involve CSS or canvas animations that trigger on certain events. It might start simple (a rotating symbol or a glow effect) as a placeholder for more complex holographic visuals later.
        
    - **Chapter/Character Theming:** Ensure the UI still applies the per-symbol theme colors and glyph in the UI (the 16 base symbols each have a color in `colors.ts` and an SVG in `/public/corpus-symbols/`[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/README.md#L24-L32)). For the 240 new glyphs, decide how (or if) they appear in the UI. Possibly, only the 16 main symbols are directly selectable chapters, while the extended glyph set is used behind the scenes for encoding data. (If the design intends user interaction with all symbols, Gemini will create an interface to browse them.)
        
    - **MCP Chat Drawer & Vault (if relevant):** Past plans (MCP/Vault) suggest an interactive chat UI[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/.claude/claude-code-tasks.md#L58-L67)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/.claude/claude-code-tasks.md#L92-L101). If this is part of the current scope, Gemini can lay out these components too (though these might be separate features). Focus remains on symbol-related UI first.
        
- **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Connect the UI to the backend APIs that Claude provides. In practical terms:
    
    - If Claude exposes an API for QDPI encoding/decoding or a route to fetch the glyph manifest, Gemini will write **frontend utility functions** or hooks to call these. For example, a button in the UI could call `/api/qdpi/encode` with some input and display the resulting symbol sequence.
        
    - Load the **glyph manifest** (from Codex) on the client if needed – for instance, to dynamically render all glyph images with proper labels. This could be done at build time or fetched on load. Gemini may create a small loader in the UI that reads `qdpi_glyph_manifest.json` so the front end knows the mapping of glyph IDs to file names/characters (if we want to display names or group symbols by character).
        
    - Ensure the **SVG assets** are accessible. The 256 SVGs might reside in a new folder (perhaps `/public/qdpi-256-glyphs/`). Gemini needs to confirm the build process includes that directory and perhaps write code to import or require these SVGs. Possibly, a dynamic import mechanism or an index file that exports all SVGs by name can be generated (Codex could assist in making such an index). Gemini will coordinate with Codex/Claude on how to reference the SVGs (file paths or embedding).
        
- **Real-Time Event UI (Kafka Integration):** Once Claude has the Kafka-based event stream running (or at least a simulation of it), Gemini will implement the **real-time visual feedback** in the UI. This likely involves:
    
    - Opening a WebSocket connection to the backend (e.g. to `ws://.../events` or similar) to listen for incoming messages.
        
    - Visualizing events in real-time. For example, if an event corresponds to a “symbol activation” or some narrative moment, the UI could highlight a glyph or play an animation. Doc 4’s holographic concept might come into play here – e.g. when an event arrives, a 3D effect on a symbol could trigger.
        
    - A concrete initial step: Gemini can create an **Event Console** component or incorporate it into an existing UI element (like a “character consciousness dashboard”). For now, it might just log events (e.g. “Symbol X activated by system Y”) on screen. As the design evolves, this can become a richer visualization (icons lighting up, connections drawn, etc.).
        
    - Ensure that the UI remains responsive and doesn’t block waiting for events. Use asynchronous patterns (WebSocket callbacks, state updates via React state or context).
        
- **Iterative Refinement:** Gemini should make the UI polished and user-friendly. This means applying TailwindCSS styles consistently (matching the retro CRT aesthetic where applicable), keeping paragraphs and text formatting as expected for the reading experience, and adding controls for any new functionality (e.g. a toggle to enable live mode vs. static mode). Short, iterative improvements are encouraged – build basic functionality first, then enhance (for instance, get the WebSocket connection working with simple text indicators, then add fancy graphics).
    
- **Restrictions & Handoff:** According to current repo policy, the Gemini agent is **not allowed to directly commit to core frontend code** (`/src` is forbidden for `user.agent=gemini` by the pre-commit hook[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/scripts/pre_commit_agent_scope.sh#L4-L8)). We have two options: (1) _Temporarily adjust_ this rule to allow Gemini’s contributions in `src/` (with caution), or (2) have Gemini output code suggestions that Claude (or the user) then commits. In this plan, we lean toward letting Gemini write the UI code directly for efficiency – thus, we may **update the agent scope rules** to permit Gemini to modify `src` (at least for UI components). This could be done by editing or disabling the hook for Gemini when needed. All UI code will be reviewed (by the user or Claude) for consistency before final merge. Gemini will **not touch backend code or story content**, focusing strictly on front-end files (React components, CSS, public assets).
    

## Asynchronous Workflow & Coordination

With each agent clear on its scope, we coordinate their efforts in parallel and merge results in stages. The development will proceed in **phases**, with asynchronous work where possible and synchronization at integration points:

**Phase 1 – Frontend & Asset Prep (Parallel):** Start with Gemini and Codex working concurrently:

- _Gemini (UI)_ begins building the core UI components and pages according to the storyboard. During this time, any static data needed (like placeholder symbol list or dummy event data) can be hardcoded or stubbed. The focus is to have the UI structure in place early (navigation, placeholders for symbol display, etc.). For example, Gemini can implement an expanded `SymbolIndex` that shows 256 slots with dummy SVGs or icons, to be replaced with real ones later. It also sets up a basic event listening component (perhaps logging to console for now).
    
- _Codex (Symbols)_ simultaneously processes the `qdpi-256-glyphs` folder and produces the `qdpi_glyph_manifest.json` (and any renamed files). This can happen without waiting for the UI. Codex can also generate a small **validation report** confirming all glyphs are accounted for[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L25-L28) – this report could be included as `qdpi_validation_report.txt` as noted in Phase 1 completion[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L52-L60), giving Claude and the team confidence in the data.
    
- These two efforts do not conflict: Gemini works in `src/` (frontend) and Codex works in `qdpi-256-glyphs/` + `docs/` (no overlapping files). Thanks to the predefined scopes, they can be truly parallel. This phase yields: a) UI skeleton (check into a branch or commit by Gemini), and b) a complete glyph manifest and organized asset folder (commit by Codex).
    

**Phase 2 – Backend Implementation (Claude builds on prepared data):**

- Once Codex has the manifest and possibly after Gemini’s initial UI components exist, **Claude (Backend)** starts integrating the QDPI logic. Claude will pull in the manifest file generated by Codex and use it to implement the encoding/decoding in `qdpi.py` (or a new module like `glyph_marrow_qdpi.py` if one is planned). Concretely, Claude can use the manifest to map bytes to SVG filenames and incorporate that into the encode/decode API (for instance, reading the JSON into a dictionary of {byte: symbolName} or similar). This fulfills the Phase 2 step “create byte-to-glyph mapping functions”[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L92-L98). Claude also ensures that any references to older 16-symbol logic are upgraded to 256.
    
- In parallel (or shortly after), Claude implements the **Kafka event streaming** components. This may involve setting up a Kafka client or server config (if not already done), but initially it can be a simplified stub: for example, a loop that emits a test event every few seconds to simulate real-time data. What’s important is that Claude provides a **WebSocket endpoint** or similar for the UI to connect to. As per the design, the WebSocket could broadcast events like `qdpi_symbol_activated` or other narrative signals[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#L135-L144)[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#L147-L155) (the QDPI Developer Guide shows similar event types). Claude doesn’t need to fully flesh out all event types at first – just establishing the pipeline (connect, send message) is enough for integration.
    
- **Synchronize:** When Claude has a basic version of the above ready (manifest integrated and a test event stream), it’s time to test end-to-end. This is a good sync point: the manifest, backend, and frontend are brought together, likely on a feature branch. The team (or user) can run the app to see if the frontend loads the symbol list (now with real SVGs via the manifest) and if an example event from the backend is received by the UI component. Debug and fix any immediate integration bugs here. For instance, adjust paths if the UI can’t find the SVG files, or fix data types if the manifest JSON parsing in backend has issues.
    

**Phase 3 – Feature Refinement & Live Feedback:**

- With the core integration working in principle, agents can again work in parallel on refinements:
    
    - _Gemini:_ Enhance the UI visuals and UX. Now that real data is in use, Gemini can replace placeholders with actual values. For example, ensure each symbol’s SVG is properly displayed (maybe as an `<img>` or inline SVG component), labeled with its name or ID if needed. Implement interactive behaviors: perhaps clicking a symbol could send an encode request or show its details. Also style the real-time event display – e.g. show a small notification or highlight on the corresponding symbol when an event arrives indicating that symbol was “activated.” If multiple event types exist, design distinct visuals for them (color codes, icons, animations).
        
    - _Claude:_ Expand the backend’s capabilities and robustness. Connect the Kafka pipeline to real sources if available (or integrate with the actual Kafka cluster if one is running). Implement any remaining logic from the Kafka Additions doc (Doc 2) – e.g. if events need to carry payloads or trigger certain backend state changes, code that in. Claude can also integrate **SREC embeddings or error correction** related to QDPI as mentioned in Phase 2 tasks[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/QDPI_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md#L92-L98), though if this is complex, it can be deferred. Another area: ensure that the API endpoints and WebSocket are secure and efficient (add checks, limit message size if needed, etc.).
        
    - _Codex:_ Assist with **quality assurance** and edge cases. Now Codex can be used to write **unit tests** or analyze edge conditions. For instance, Codex could write tests for the QDPI encode/decode: feed random bytes and ensure decode(encode(data)) returns the original data for many samples. It can also test the event pipeline by simulating events and checking UI state changes (if we have an automated way, or at least log inspection). Additionally, Codex can update any documentation: if the QDPI Developer Guide (Doc 1) needs an update now that the system is implemented, Codex can draft those changes.
        
- **Synchronization and Review:** After these improvements, do another round of testing. This time, the focus is on **real-time behavior** – run the system with the event stream on and verify that the front end responds instantly and correctly (e.g. if an event says “glyph_marrow activated”, the Glyph Marrow symbol highlights in the UI). Check that all 256 glyphs can be encoded/decoded (maybe via a script that encodes all byte values and then decodes them – Codex can help generate such a script). Also, review code for cleanliness and adherence to project style (run Prettier/ESLint, etc.). Fix any cross-agent boundary issues (for example, if Gemini’s UI expected an event in a different format than what Claude sends, adjust one side accordingly).
    

**Phase 4 – Deployment Prep and Next Steps:**

- Once the multi-agent contributions are merged and stable, prepare for deployment or broader testing. This includes updating environment configs or documentation: for example, instruct how to run the Kafka component (Docker configs or required ENV vars), and how to serve the large number of SVGs (ensuring the build includes them). Codex can assist by writing a short **deployment note** or updating the `README.md` if needed (e.g. “Added QDPI 256 integration: ensure `/public/qdpi-256-glyphs` folder is served, etc.”).
    
- Plan for future improvements (not necessarily done now, but acknowledged): The “4D holography” UI might be further enhanced with WebGL or more complex visuals; the Kafka events might evolve into a full timeline playback feature; the DSPy multi-agent could be expanded beyond Glyph Marrow to other characters (Jacklyn, London Fox, etc.) interacting. Each agent can be re-engaged for those future tasks in their domain.
    

Throughout all phases, maintain **communication and version control discipline**. Each agent’s work should be done in its own branch or clearly labeled commits (the `user.agent` Git config helps with this by tagging commits as coming from codex, gemini, or claude). The repo’s pre-commit hook already prevents an agent from accidentally modifying out-of-scope files[GitHub](https://github.com/mbu09a/the-gibsey-project/blob/9d584661a571430f941fa26d7bed87430373d576/scripts/pre_commit_agent_scope.sh#L11-L14) – we will update these rules as needed (e.g. to allow Gemini’s src commits) but continue to enforce separation of concerns. This way, merge conflicts are minimized and it’s clear who contributed what.

Finally, ensure that **all citations, attributions, and documentation** remain intact and updated. As we embed the new features, any reference docs (like QDPI guides or architecture overviews) should be revised by Codex or Claude to reflect the latest implementation. The goal is a cohesive system where backend logic, symbol data, and UI **all function in harmony**, achieved through the orchestrated yet independent efforts of our three AI agents working asynchronously.
