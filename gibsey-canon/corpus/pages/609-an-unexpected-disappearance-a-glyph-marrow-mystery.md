Woah, those dreams from last night had really gotten to him, huh?

He's still sweating profusely.

He reaches the end of the line, and motions to a cast member.

They'd been uniformed to dress like a woman out on the frontier.

Name tag reads, Tanya.

Seems as chipper and heightened with energy as any of the cast members here.

Just as good to check with her as anybody.

"Hey, real quick, I have a question."

"Of course, how can I help you?"

"Do you know a fella by the name of Glyph Marrow by any chance?"

"Oh, of course I do! He's one of our regulars, comes here and rides the ride all the time, nearly every day, almost."

"Oh, thank Gibsey! Well, have you seen him around here recently?"

"You know, come to think of it, I haven't. It's maybe even been a couple weeks. Huh? I guess he's been busy?"

"Oh, yeah, I guess so."

"You ready to board the most wild ride in the west?"

"Oh, uh. Sure."
