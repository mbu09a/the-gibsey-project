This is described, more colloquially, in non-mystical terms, with a set of symbols within our film industry-to roll sound, lights, camera, and action--meaning that nearly all mystics describe their experiences with such symbols, symbols such as sound, light, vision, and action. And consider these as symbols: light, sound, vision, and action. Are all of these, and even the name of Gibsey himself, The Author of our civilization and world, are these symbols, all of these symbols-lights, camera, and action, as well as the name of Gibsey-not symbolic representations of an ultimate reality which is also empty though it is intended to be filled, unformed, and amorphous?

But these forms, these structures, much like the structures of amusement park rides, are alternatively broken down and built back up in the course of the mystic's development, reflecting certain assumptions about the nature of reality, which originated in, and derived their authority from, philosophical traditions, and then found confirmation within these traditions, establishing a home, a territory, a landscape within the mystical Gibseyan tradition.

In general then, the mystic's experience tends to confirm the traditions under which they live; its theology and symbols are projected into their mystical experiences but do not spring from them. But again, ironically and contrastingly, a mystic is who they are, precisely because they stand in direct, productive opposition to the object of their experiences, and through this, they transform the content of the tradition within which they live. This accounts for the progressive character of certain mystics and the communities they influence which accept the symbols in which mystics of this type have communicated their experiences.
