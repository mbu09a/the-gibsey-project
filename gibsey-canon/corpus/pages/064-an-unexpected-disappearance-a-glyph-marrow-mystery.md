Arieol considers putting a hand in front of Glyph's face and moving it up and down to poke fun at the rib's of Glyph's astonishment, but then decides to take a crack at another diatribe instead.

"Not trusting your own reactions, huh? Happens to all of us. But I'm sure you won't trust mine, either, at least not initially. Usually the principal being investigated isn't announcing to the detective that they're the one whom they're supposed to be investigating. And it's funny. Usually you'd be the one narrating this scene, as such, like how you did back there at the station, which would then make you the unreliable one, but then what's this that's happening? Is it truly something different? Or have I just taken over?"

Arieol smiles.

Glyph clutches the hand rest like it'll save his soul from the devil himself.

"Tell me, Glyph, what's it like when you, who's already been established as the narrator of sorts—or the subject at the very least—is now being questioned by a narrator that's entirely alien to you, and that's outside you, one that sits next to you in the plush confines of your favorite park attraction, just as it's just about to begin? Do any memories come to mind? Any ailments? Well, ya know what? If you don't remember, then maybe we could invent some? You're interested in words, aren't you? Actually, with your shocked stupefaction, maybe you should let me do the talking. I won't monologue for long though, I promise, or if I do, I promise to at least make it interesting. And you can enter the dialogue at any time. I give you my word on that, Glyph!
