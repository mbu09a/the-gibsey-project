And what is being emphasized?

These dark trees are here to replace Bambino.

Dead, they are still, natural, organic, and ominous. They are objects, here to contrast Bambino as subject, Bambino as subject retreats, is pushed to retreat, all as the audience is retreating within themselves.

Like all Gibseyan scripture, like all Gibseyan classics, this is something, a scene, which all audience members have experienced before.

And they will again.

It is eternal.

Bambino, both the character and the title of the film, not an uncommon choice in the early scriptures, is the saddest most memorable creature to have ever existed on screen.

What newness of experience, what isolating intimidation to stand before the coming tower, the rising tower, to face the Buck, to stand and be confronted by the fatherland itself, distilled into a singular image.

"Your mother can't be with you anymore."
