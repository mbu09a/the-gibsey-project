But wait, no, the second card wasn't fate, it's what's called The Obstacle, which meant it was maybe their own anger, their own lack of forgiveness, their bitterness, that was blinding them, getting in their way, what they should pinch out with their teeth and gulp on down even if they didn't enjoy it and wasn't used to the taste.

Pain itself was The Obstacle.

What else could the card even denote?

There was no curse but the curse itself.

But it didn't take long for Arieol to retreat from the full awareness of this idea-it never does for any of us-to send it back on down to the 1st observation, back to the scraggly old depths of the unconscious where it belongs, where it can whimper and pine for its lack of acceptance to please finally be healed, back with the wretched wastes of the rest of those ravenous thoughts of theirs.

Good Gibsey, they felt disturbed, and more and more everyday.

Wait, speaking of, hadn't they witnessed some fleshy monstrosity mending itself, winding itself atop Parlance's own skin earlier?

And Arieol had barely even noticed it, let alone Parlance!

All they'd done was write down a quick little note about it?

Malt Gibsey!

They needed to check back on the poor bastard!

And so they did, shape-shifter that they are.

Back at the bench, without any time seeming to pass at all.

Huh?

They forget-shape-shifting, wandering, fragmenting-it all does come with its own non-linear benefits, after all.
