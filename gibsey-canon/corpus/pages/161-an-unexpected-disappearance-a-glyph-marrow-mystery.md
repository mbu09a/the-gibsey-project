It only ever happened when they'd been drinking, from what they remember..

Not really a surprise.

As common as it could possibly be.

They had to be in denial.

Glyph had to be the one.

They'd hidden themselves beneath layers, mummified beneath layers of skin.

They'd placed themselves in a tomb.

Any landscape?

Then what about a bar?

Would Shamrock Stillman meet them there?

It's pouring rain.

They sprint from their car, trying to shelter themselves from the downpour. They're totally soaked without an umbrella, but knowing that it's possible that they're going to see Stillman again, they can still deal with it. If anything, the streetlights and headlights, the mirrors and neon, all of it's so much more beautiful in the rain, giving the light a chance to reflect off so many puddles and surfaces, and all of it created by the rain itself.

It all has a mind of its own.

The rain turns every surface into a statue, even mud pots.

It's all so beautiful, the rain.
