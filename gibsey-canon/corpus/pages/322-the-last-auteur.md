Going to Gibsey World is like entering a movie, like being inside a movie, literally.

It's like a living movie, like being on set, behind the screen, back-stage, as they call it.

I mean, it's funny to think about, isn't it?

Oh, and did I mention the drool that's started to hang out of Scrillio's mouth by this point?

I shit you not.

Whole globs of it, the slob that he is, and in front of the whole crew!

I mean, what a fucking imbecile!

And, oh shit, actually Arieol, maybe be careful about writing that detail down.

I'm not saying it's a sexual thing or anything.

He isn't ogling at anyone.

He's just, well, he's incapacitated, or he at least seems to be.

Just make that clear.

He's just mentally incapacitated or something

I don't want to be misunderstood by future viewers.

And god forbid I'm misunderstood by future viewers. Shit do they just love to misunderstand you these days, don't they?

And you know what?

They use that misunderstanding to gain power for themselves, don't they?

That terrifies me, Arieol, terrifies me to no end.

They're becoming the real masters now, Arieol, these readers, the viewers, the public.

I mean, by Gibsey, we may have actually lived up to our Gibseyan creed after all, giving them all that power.

It terrifies me to no end.

But you cut what you can cut.

And you have to.

And if there's anything I don't want in this scene, Arieol, it's that, what I just said, so don't put that in the script. Got it?

OK?
