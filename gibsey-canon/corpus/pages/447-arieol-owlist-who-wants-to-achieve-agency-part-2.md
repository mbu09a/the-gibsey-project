If you're not sure whether your actions are predetermined, how can you feel responsible for anything you do?

If you're not sure whether you're real, how can you live authentically?

These are the questions that torment The Author.

And these are the questions that Progresso, in his wisdom or his indifference, would probably dismiss as "overthinking" or "philosophy" or "the kind of stuff that doesn't matter in the real world."

But for The Author, these questions are the real world.

These questions are what make the difference between a life worth living and a life that's just... happening.

So The Author writes this letter, not because they expect Progresso to understand or respond or care, but because writing it is one of the few actions they can take that feels genuinely their own.

Even if it isn't.

Even if this letter, too, is being dictated by someone else.

Even if The Author's attempt to assert their agency is just another plot point in someone else's story.

At least they're trying.

At least they're attempting to break free from the paralysis of uncertainty.

At least they're choosing to act, even in the face of their doubt about whether choice is possible.

And maybe that's enough.

Maybe that's what agency actually is: not the guarantee of free will, but the decision to behave as if you have it.
