As I'm sure you've noticed I'm not usually all that spontaneous within my lectures. One could even say I'm repetitious to a fault. When I teach a course, I've usually taught it quite a few times, over and over again, until I've honed it to a bit of a diamond, if you don't mind me saying so. I've typically left the twists and turns for the Imaginators and screenwriters that work for the Malt Gibsey Company, focusing on providing the straight facts of Gibstory. Even when covering esoteric subjects such as Gibseyan Mysticism, The Corpus, or other such topics, I've always taken an objective, consistent, and Gibstorical approach, and typically this will continue to be the case. However, today, I want to step out of my comfort zone and try something new, something novel, a structural choice I often claim would be beneficial to my teaching practice, but something I hardly ever actually put into practice. And I'm hoping that by spicing things up a bit, and by breaking out of my routine, that I might be able to provide you with a lecture that's more memorable and impactful for you, in the long term. It may not be as well rehearsed, structured, or methodical as my previous lectures you've heard within this course, but I'm hoping that the strength of its effects, as well as the fact that I'm drawing from more uniquely contemporary material, can justify this infraction of my normal habits.
