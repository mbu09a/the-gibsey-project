As corporate agents working for the Agency of Data and Detection, we do our best to remain objective, unbiased, and impartial as possible regarding the data and textual documents we are hired to evaluate, and therefore must suspend our own sense of both reality and unreality, as well as our subjective and informal interests when evaluating such material. However, without a clear functional purpose provided by the Media Analysis State Services departments, or by A.D.D. itself, aside from the directive to pursue continued analysis of the texts and individuals in question, the current evaluator will be forced to eventually take subjective and informal methods. This unfortunate procedural choice will also likely need to be made due to the lack of personnel and funding currently being provided for the project. This lack of formality will be used at an absolute minimum basis, and an objective analysis of such texts will always be attempted when possible, and as often as possible, as is expected to occur within Daily A.D.D. Yearly Summary Documents. Whenever an inevitable exception to this will be made in future analysis reports, such situations will be made evidently and explicitly clear. To briefly and temporarily switch into 1st person and make myself clearer in a more temporarily individualized and subjective manner: I will only provide subjective commentary of this kind, such as I am doing now, when it is absolutely necessary.
