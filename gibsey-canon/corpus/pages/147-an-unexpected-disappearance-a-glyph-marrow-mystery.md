"Yes, I left Glyph back there at the top of the First Ascent, and I've come up with some good ideas since then, but I just--I just feel like I've left out too many things."

"What do you mean? In the previous chapters?"

"I haven't gotten to Stillman yet, for example."

"You'll have to remind me."

"Shamrock Stillman, they're supposed to be Glyph's partner, a fellow detective. They reach out to him with their new assignment at the end of the first chapter, but I just, I-I haven't been able to figure out how to get them back into the story again."

"Is there a reason for that?"

"Maybe."

"I can tell there's a reason."

"I'm not supposed to say."

"Uh, huh."

"What? I can't say!"

"I thought you didn't believe in spoilers? Everything doesn't always have to be linear all the time, isn't that what you always say?"

"I don't! I just, it's just really hard to explain."
