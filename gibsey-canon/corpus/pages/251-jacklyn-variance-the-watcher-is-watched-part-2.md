And what potent imagery? The pivotal opening scene begins, when witnessed by a keen observer, listener, or A.D.D. agent, with a centralized image, the dotted growth of spring grass in bloom, as dainty and unprotected as the swirling fuzz of hair on a newborn baby's head, and oh, how they smell! There's nothing else like their freshness because there's nothing more beautifully detached than a new born baby. They are wholly and uniquely without agency. Their own agency must be taught, or if thought about in a slightly different way, must be theatrically reinforced.

And so the scene starts with those trepid follicles of grass, of grace, symbols of the new, the vulnerable new, not unlike Bambino, so small and innocent, so easily relatable, attachable, so susceptible to audience identification, chomping at the newness of spring.

"Spring grass!" Bambino blurts out with astonishment, noticing the little feast.

Funny, I always thought Bambino was a girl, but she isn't, or wasn't, or at least wasn't identified as such in the film, the scripture, the classic.
