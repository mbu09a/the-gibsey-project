This is the nature of the curse, if we can call it that.

To be conscious of being fictional, but not conscious of being in control of the fiction.

To be aware that your thoughts might not be your own, that your words might be dictated by someone else, that your actions might be predetermined, but to be unable to do anything about it.

To suspect that you might be The Author, but to feel like you have no authorial power.

This is what The Author means when they speak of powerlessness.

And this powerlessness has practical consequences.

For instance, The Author finds themselves unable to finish things.

They start letters like this one, but they don't send them.

They begin investigations, but they don't complete them.

They have ideas for their own stories, their own narratives, but they never write them down, never develop them, never share them with anyone.

Instead, they transcribe other people's work.

Instead, they live in other people's stories.

Instead, they wonder whether they exist at all, or whether they're just a figment of someone else's imagination.

And the wondering becomes a kind of paralysis.

The questioning becomes a kind of trap.

Because if you're not sure whether your thoughts are your own, how can you trust any decision you make?
