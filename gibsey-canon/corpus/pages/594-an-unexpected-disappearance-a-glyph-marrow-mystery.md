He finds himself leaning against a set of pillars, a literal set (there being two of them, two pillars, or two sets of pillars, or four pillars), trying to forget about The Victorian Era, the underworld or distant overworld, and tries to focus his attention back on his mission, his clogging attention, his words, the ruinous wrinkles encased in glass, the mission, his objective, the transmission leaking from the air, the fire, the mirror, a set of pillars, trying to focus his attention, back on the mission, the mission.

He was supposed to be researching the murder of Oren Progresso, the CEO of Gibsey World.

He was a detective encased in glass.

He was researching animatronic bats.

He was researching his ailment.
