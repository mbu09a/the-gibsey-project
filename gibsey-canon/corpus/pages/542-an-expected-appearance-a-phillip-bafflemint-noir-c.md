He even passes one area of town-sweating, heaving, his blood drumming, hyper-ventalating, still unable to believe what he's seeing-where hundreds of bats were unleashed to scatter into the air.

Who had managed to wrangle and control such untamably diseased beasts?

Was this their idea of a park attraction?

The hot dog and ice cream vendors?

For Gibsey's sake, the Dickey Dog Clubs?

His mind scrambles for relief, for some sort of shelter or reliability beyond the heat and horrors of this place.

He supposes it'll all get consumed by and assimilated into Gibsey World soon enough, anyway, though the Gibstory was always a little vague about when Gibsey took over all civilizations, let alone the more localized American ones of the park's origin, or the even more localized cities of the southern state of Texas.
