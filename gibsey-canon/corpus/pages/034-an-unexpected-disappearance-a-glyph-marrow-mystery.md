Waiting in line.

The first sensation that comes to me when I first notice my ailment is when I pass a spigot of water falling into a small pond.

Wait, no.

That's not right, is it?

Was it a pond?

That doesn't sound right?

But then what was it?

It's not a lake?

But it's also not a pond either?

Let me consider this word, or these words, for a moment. It's a constructed flow of water coming out of a spigot in the middle of a queue line in the western section of The Magical Dominion, a theme park in Malt Gibsey World meant to simulate the locale of an 1890s mining railroad.

It's artificial, unnatural, and unreal.

What could you even begin to call it? It'sâ€”it's not even a real spigot!

No one interacts with it except for maybe a few kids whose parents aren't paying attention?

What would it even be called? A pool?

Well, that doesn't sound right either.

But I don't know?
