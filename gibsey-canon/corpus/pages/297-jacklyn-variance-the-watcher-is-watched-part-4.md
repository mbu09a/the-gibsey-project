But what about a splitter in particular?

That was the exact title of the movie he'd mentioned wasn't it?

A person or thing designated for splitting something.

A person, especially a taxonomist, who attaches more importance to differences than similarities in classification.

And what the hell was taxonomy again?

A branch of science concerned with classification, such as the classification of organisms, though it can also be used to create an index of knowledge stored as documents, articles, videos, records of data, so that users can access information more readily.

But what about Preston's explanation, the headphone jack image? What did it have to do with anything?

A device with two electrical plugs that plugs into an electrical outlet, converting the outlet into a two-outlet converter.

That was a much better description than what he'd initially given.
